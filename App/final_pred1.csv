Attention is concentrated here on the mechanical (stress-related) effects that commonly arise, with the possibility of stresses (in-plane only) and strains within both constituents being generated in a variety of ways. In the treatment presented here, edge effects are ignored, which simplifies matters, but considerable attention is paid to the way in which the system may become curved, and to the relationship between the curvature and the internal stresses and strains.

Two main cases are considered, depending on whether it is possible for the assumption to be made that the coating is very much thinner than the substrate. If this is the case, then certain assumptions can be made and some relatively simple equations can be used to describe the behaviour. On the other hand, it is emphasized that there are many practical cases for which this condition cannot be assumed, although (slightly more complex) analytical treatments can then be employed and these are described here in some detail.

It is also worth noting that a further distinction can be drawn, depending on whether the stress state within the coating (and substrate) comprises a uniaxial (in-plane) stress or an equal biaxial set of (in-plane) stresses, with the latter being much more common. In this case, it is explained that the ratio of stress to strain in any given (in-plane) direction is given by the biaxial modulus, rather than the Young’s modulus (for a uniaxial stress state).

Finally, a brief outline is presented of how the stored elastic strain energy associated with the presence of stresses in a coating (and substrate) constitutes a driving force for spallation (interfacial crack propagation). A simple criterion is presented for advance of such a crack and some examples are given of how this can be utilized in some practical cases.

(  spontaneous debonding. this video shows a set of coated samples (zirconia on alumina substrates) being withdrawn from a furnace and cooled by gas jets. the cooling creates differential thermal contraction stresses and, once these have become sufficiently large, coatings can spontaneously debond. such an event can be seen at the end of this short video.   (  in situ curvature measurement. this video, which has a commentary, explains how, provided the substrate is relatively thin, the deposition of a coating (in this case by thermal spraying of ceramics onto metal substrates) generates curvature, which can be monitored as the coating thickness increases. in conjunction with a numerical model, this can be used to infer the residual stress levels in coatings produced under a range of conditions.   (  debonding during cooling of thin substrate with coatings.  this video, which has a commentary, explains how stored residual stresses provide a driving force for debonding (spallation). it is also explained how estimates can be made of the interfacial toughness (fracture energy) from observations of debonding during cooling.   (  debonding under applied load of coatings with residual stresses. this video, which has a commentary, goes briefly through the -point bend delamination test for coatings that already contain stored residual stresses. it is shown how this can be used to measure the interfacial fracture energy.. the title of the content is .: spallation (interfacial debonding)","Driving Force for Spallation

The presence of residual stresses in a substrate/coating system constitutes a driving force for debonding (spallation), since such stresses will almost certainly be at least partially relaxed when this occurs, releasing stored elastic strain energy. The key process is that of propagation of a crack along the interface, driven by the associated release of this stored energy. This propagation is illustrated below, for a (Stoney) case in which there is just a single (uniform) stress in the coating.

It can be seen that propagation of this interfacial crack will be energetically favoured if the driving force (strain energy release rate) is equal to or greater than the (mode II - ie shearing mode) fracture energy of the interface, Gic:

\[E_{d}^{\prime} \epsilon_{d}^{2} h\left(=\frac{\sigma_{d}^{2} h}{E_{d}^{\prime}}\right) \geq G_{\mathrm{ic}}\]

This takes no account of any barrier to initiation of the crack. In many cases, however, there are likely to be relatively large defects present in the interface, so the above condition may well lead to spallation. It certainly means that the coating is (thermodynamically) unstable. Immediate implications are (unsurprisingly) that high stresses and brittle interfaces (low Gic) make debonding more likely. Also clear (and widely observed) is that thicker coatings are more likely to debond than thinner ones.

Debonding for non-Stoney Cases

The same concept can be applied to more general cases - ie when the h&lt;&lt;H condition does not apply. Debonding will still tend to allow a reduction in the stored elastic strain energy, constituting a driving force for spallation. However, since there is now a distribution of stress (and strain) in the through-thickness (y) direction, an integration is needed to evaluate the driving force

\[G_{i}=\int_{-H}^{h} \frac{\sigma(y)^{2}}{E^{\prime}(y)} \mathrm{d} y\]

This is based on the assumption that these stresses become totally relaxed during debonding. This might be the case - for example, the sets of stresses and strains that have been predicted to arise from imposition of a uniform misfit strain would completely disappear if the coating could debond. In practice, however, the stress distribution within the system may be more complex than this. For example, it’s common for stresses to be created in a coating during its formation. As such a coating gets thicker, balancing of forces and moments takes place progressively, so that conditions change and the final stress distribution is not one corresponding to imposition of a uniform misfit strain. In such cases, debonding may leave some residual stresses (and residual curvature of the coating and possibly of the substrate). The net driving force may then be written

\[G_{i}=\int_{-H}^{h} \frac{\sigma(y)^{2}}{E^{\prime}(y)} \mathrm{d} y-\int_{-H}^{h} \frac{\sigma_{r}(y)^{2}}{E^{\prime}(y)} \mathrm{d} y\]

where σr(y) is the residual stress distribution after debonding.

Debonding of coatings is, of course, commonly observed, since virtually all coatings contain at least some stresses and the associated strain energy can rise above the critical level - for example, as a result of temperature changes, thickening (eg oxide growth), stiffening (eg due to sintering), applied forces or bending moments etc. Also, the toughness (fracture energy) of the interface (Gic) may fall with time - eg due to chemical attack etc. The video clips below give some examples of how coating spallation can be observed and analysed.

Spontaneous Debonding. This video shows a set of coated samples (zirconia on alumina substrates) being withdrawn from a furnace and cooled by gas jets. The cooling creates differential thermal contraction stresses and, once these have become sufficiently large, coatings can spontaneously debond. Such an event can be seen at the end of this short video.

In Situ Curvature Measurement. This video, which has a commentary, explains how, provided the substrate is relatively thin, the deposition of a coating (in this case by thermal spraying of ceramics onto metal substrates) generates curvature, which can be monitored as the coating thickness increases. In conjunction with a numerical model, this can be used to infer the residual stress levels in coatings produced under a range of conditions.

The Stoney equation is still in widespread use. It relates the curvature of a substrate with a thin coating to the stress level within the coating (for an equal biaxial case). It was proposed in 1909 - a long time before the relationship described in earlier pages (for the general case in which the coating thickness is not negligible compared to that of the substrate) was established. However, it is easy to show that the Stoney equation can be derived from that relationship, by imposing the h &lt;&lt; H condition, which allows all of the denominator terms except the last one to be discarded and (h + H) = H to be assumed, so that

\[\kappa=\frac{6 E_{\mathrm{d}}^{\prime} h \Delta \epsilon}{E_{\mathrm{s}}^{\prime} H^{2}}\]

with the biaxial moduli now being used. Furthermore, the \(h \ll H\) condition allows the assumption to be made that all of the misfit strain is accommodated in the coating (deposit), so only the coating is under stress. In addition, the Stoney equation is based on an equal biaxial stress state, so that the biaxial versions of these Young’s moduli should be used and the misfit strain can be expressed as

\[\Delta \epsilon=\frac{-\sigma_{d}}{E_{\mathrm{d}}^{\prime}}\]

recognizing that, with the convention we are using for \(\Delta \epsilon\), a positive value will generate a negative value for \(\sigma_{d}\) (ie a compressive stress). Substitution of this then leads to the Stoney equation:

\[\kappa=\frac{-6 E_{\mathrm{d}}^{\prime} h \sigma_{\mathrm{d}}}{E_{\mathrm{s}}^{\prime} H^{2} E_{\mathrm{d}}^{\prime}}=\frac{-6 h \sigma_{\mathrm{d}}}{E_{\mathrm{s}}^{\prime} H^{2}} \quad \therefore \sigma_{\mathrm{d}}=\frac{-E_{\mathrm{s}}^{\prime} H^{2}}{6 h\left(1-\nu_{\mathrm{s}}\right)} \kappa\]

(The minus sign is not always included, but the curvature should have a sign and, using the convention that a convex upper surface corresponds to positive curvature, this implies a negative deposit stress.) This equation allows a coating stress to be obtained from a (measured) curvature. Only E and ν values for the substrate are needed - this is convenient, since they are often known (whereas those of the coating may not be). A single stress value is obtained - if the coating is thin, then any through-thickness variation in its value is likely to be small. It is really the misfit strain that is the more fundamental measure of the characteristics of the system, but a stress value is often regarded as more easily interpreted.

Approach to Stoney Conditions

The Stoney equation is easy to use and, indeed, is widely used. However, it does have the limitation of being accurate only in a regime in which the curvatures tend to be relatively small. In some applications – such as with semiconductor wafers – surfaces are very smooth, so that highly accurate optical methods of curvature measurement are feasible and this is not such a problem. However, when curvatures are high (or need to be high for reliable measurement), the Stoney equation should not be used. The simulation below allows exploration of the conditions under which the Stoney equation gives a good or poor approximation to the actual behaviour.

A simple type of misfit strain is that arising from differential thermal expansion (in a 2-layer system).

The misfit strain (in the x-direction) is given by the product of the difference in expansivity between the two constituents and the temperature change. It is often written as Δε. The fact that the two layers are actually bonded together leads to creation of internal stresses and strains, and to changes in the shape of the system - see the next page.

Sources of Misfit Strains

What are effectively misfit strains can arise in a number of ways. One of the simplest is differential thermal contraction, but anything that creates a difference between the (in-plane) stress-free dimensions of a substrate and a coating (or a surface layer of a substrate) has a similar effect. These include phase changes, plastic deformation, creep etc, as well as phenomena, such as atomic bombardment, that can create stresses during formation of a coating.

(if we simply applied an external bending moment, rather than an internal misfit strain, then there would be no strain at the neutral axis.). the title of the content is .: force and moment balances","Force Balance

The fact that the two layers are in fact bonded together must now be taken into account. Assuming first that the layers remain flat, there is clearly a requirement that both must end up with the same length (in the x-direction). This will require a tensile stress to be created in one layer (the one that is initially shorter) and a compressive stress in the other. The forces acting in each layer (in the x-direction) must add up to the externally applied force (ie a force balance must apply).

This is illustrated in the figure below. (The subscripts d and s represent “deposit” and “substrate” - ie the upper and lower layers.)

Moment Balance

The force balance is relatively straightforward, but the situation depicted in the figure above does not represent complete static equilibrium. This is because the forces being exerted by the stresses acting in the two layers produce a bending moment that tends to create curvature in the x-y plane - for the case shown, the top surface would become convex. The distributions of stress and strain must therefore change, creating an internal balancing moment (and also creating curvature), while maintaining a force balance.

Using the moment balance to find the curvature (and the associated stress and strain distributions) is slightly more complex than applying the force balance. Derivation of the expression for the curvature is shown here (https://www.doitpoms.ac.uk/tlplib/coating_mechanics/general_curvature_equation.php). The outcome is:

\[\kappa=\frac{6 E_{d} E_{s}(h+H) h H \Delta \varepsilon}{E_{d}^{2} h^{4}+4 E_{d} E_{s} h^{3} H+6 E_{d} E_{s} h^{2} H^{2}+4 E_{d} E_{s} h H^{3}+E_{s}^{2} H^{4}}\]

It’s important to recognize that the curvature of a beam is equal to the through-thickness gradient of the associated (in-plane) strain distribution. The other key concept here is that of the neutral axis of the beam. This is the location - strictly, it’s a plane (in 3-D), rather than an axis - where no (in-plane) strains arise from the bending (adoption of curvature). Its location, for a 2-layer system, is derived here (https://www.doitpoms.ac.uk/tlplib/coating_mechanics/source.php). The result is:

\[\delta=\frac{\left(h^{2} E_{d}-H^{2} E_{s}\right)}{2\left(h E_{d}+H E_{s}\right)}\]

Using these equations, the final outcome (of imposing a misfit strain) can be obtained. This is illustrated in the figure below. It should be noted that adoption of curvature does NOT lead to zero strain at the neutral axis, but rather to NO CHANGE there - ie it remains at the value resulting from the force balance.

What is meant by a ""misfit strain""?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| a | A strain corresponding to the difference in stress-free dimensions of two constituents that are bonded together in some way. | 
| b |                                              A strain that needs to be imposed on a coating in order to make it stress-free. | 
| c |                       A strain resulting from imposition of the condition that coating and substrate remain bonded together. | 
| d |                                         A strain that arises between coating and substrate as a result of temperature change | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Answer

A

Why does curvature tend to arise in a coating-substrate system, as a result of the stresses in each constituent caused by imposing a force balance?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| a |                                                       The curvature arises because it allows the stress in the coating to be completely relaxed. | 
| b |                                                                     The force balance cannot be satisfied unless it is accompanied by curvature. | 
| c | There is a lateral separation between the axes along which the corresponding forces act, so a bending moment is generated, creating a curvature. | 
| d |                              The forces that arise act along axes that are not parallel, so a bending moment is generated, creating a curvature. | 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Answer

C

Which of these conditions is sufficient to ensure that the Stoney equation is a good approximation for the relationship between coating stress and curvature?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| a |                                                      The stress state is an equal biaxial one. | 
| b |                                                     The coating is thinner than the substrate. | 
| c |                                 The stiffness of the coating is lower than that of the coating | 
| d | The magnitude of the average stress in the coating is much greater than that in the substrate. | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Answer

D. The other three conditions will all tend to favour conditions in which the Stoney equation is likely to be reliable, but they are not sufficient individually for this to be the case.

| b |                                                             It corresponds to the stress-strain ratio (in an elastic system) in any in-plane direction, for an equal biaxial stress state, and it is larger than the Young's modulus because of Poisson effects. | 
| c |                                                                                                 It corresponds to the stress-strain ratio (in an elastic system) in any in-plane direction and it is larger than the Young's modulus because of Poisson effects. | 
| d | It corresponds to the stress-strain ratio (in an elastic system) in any in-plane direction, for an equal biaxial stress state, and it is larger than the Young's modulus because of the Poisson contraction arising from a stress in another in-plane direction. |

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| a | It is the line along which, when an initially unstressed beam is subjected to a bending moment, no strains arise while the beam becomes curved. | 
| b |                                                                              It is the line along which there are no shear strains in the beam. |

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Answer

A. It is important to note that, while the adoption of curvature will not change the (in-plane) strain at the neutral axis, the strain will only be zero at that location if that was the case before the curvature was created.

| d | Through-thickness gradient of the in-plane strain (in the plane of curvature) induced by the adoption of curvature. |

D. It is often instructive to think of the curvature as a through-thickness strain gradient (rather than in terms of the location of the centre of curvature).

Which of these statements regarding debonding (spallation) of coatings is incorrect?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| a |            If the residual stress in a coating is compressive, rather than tensile, then it is less likely to debond from the substrate. | 
| b |                                Coatings are more likely to debond if the coating / substrate interface is brittle (has a low toughness). | 
| c | The main driving force for debonding of many coatings is the stored elastic strain energy associated with the residual stresses in them. | 
| d |                                                                               Thick coatings tend to debond more readily than thin ones. | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Answer

A. The magnitude of the driving force for debonding is independent of the sign of the stress - it appears in a squared term.

The corresponding components of the displacement vector are \((u, v, w)\). In the remainder of the notes, the axi-symmetric deformation is assumed, which would require the loading to be axi-symmetric as well. This assumption brings four important implications

The circumferential component of the displacement is zero, \(v \equiv 0\)

There are no in-plane shear strains, \(\epsilon_{r\theta} = 0\)

The radial and circumferential strains are principal strains

The partial differential equations for plates reduces to the ordinary differential equation where the radius is the only space variable.

Many simple closed-form solutions can be obtained for circular and annular plates under different boundary and loading conditions. Therefore such plates are often treated as prototype structures on which certain physical principles could be easily explained.

The membrane strains on the middle surface are stated without derivation

\[\epsilon_{rr}^{\circ} = \frac{du}{dr} + \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{dw}{dr} \right)^2\]

\[\epsilon_{\theta \theta}^{\circ} = \frac{u}{r}\]

The two principal curvatures are

\[\kappa_{rr} = - \frac{d^2w}{dr^2}\]

\[\kappa_{\theta \theta} = -\frac{1}{r}\frac{dw}{dr}\]

\[\epsilon_{rr}(r,z) = \epsilon_{rr}^{\circ}(r) + z\kappa_{rr}\]

\[\epsilon_{\theta \theta}(r,z) = \epsilon_{\theta \theta}^{\circ}(r) + z\kappa_{\theta \theta}\]

So far, attention has been concentrated on a single (in-plane) direction. For conventional (in-plane) uniaxial loading of a bilayer sample, or for applying a bending moment to it, this is appropriate. It’s also possible to generate a misfit strain in a single (in-plane) direction. However, while this is possible, it’s actually rather unusual. More commonly, the same misfit strain is generated simultaneously in all in-plane directions, a state that can be represented by creating the strain in two arbitrary (in-plane) directions that are normal to each other. This will lead to an Equal Biaxial stress state (since all in-plane directions are clearly equivalent and the through-thickness stress, σy, is often taken to be zero - there is no normal stress at a free surface). Differential thermal contraction would normally have this effect. It’s also possible to create an Unequal Biaxial stress state. This would arise, for example, during differential thermal contraction with one or both of the layers exhibiting in-plane anisotropy in thermal expansivity, so that the misfit strain would be different in different in-plane directions. (Also, anisotropy in stiffness would lead to different stresses in different in-plane directions, even if the misfit strains were equal.) It is, however, common to at least assume that all in-plane directions are equivalent, in terms of both properties and misfit strains.

Poisson Effects

The main reason why the case of an equal biaxial misfit strain differs from that of a uniaxial one is related to Poisson effects. The strains arising in the selected in-plane direction (the x-direction) will be accompanied by Poisson strains in the other two (principal) directions. That in the through-thickness (y) direction is often of little consequence, but in the other in-plane (z) direction, it will need to be added to the outcome of the effects arising in that direction (from the misfit strain in that direction). The upshot of this is actually rather simple. By symmetry, the two in-plane stresses (and strains) must be equal - ie σx = σz. For isotropic elastic properties and no through-thickness stress (σy = 0), the strain in the x-direction can be written in terms of the three principal stresses:

\[\varepsilon_{x} E=\sigma_{x}-\nu\left(\sigma_{y}+\sigma_{z}\right)=\sigma_{x}(1-v)\]

where ν is the Poisson ratio. The ratio of stress to strain in the x-direction (and all in-plane directions) can therefore be expressed

\[\frac{\sigma_{x}}{\epsilon_{x}}=\frac{E}{(1-\nu)}=E^{\prime}\]

This modified form of the Young’s modulus, E’ (often termed the Biaxial Modulus), is applicable in expressions referring to substrate/coating systems having an equal biaxial stress state. The effective stiffness (stress/strain ratio) has been raised by this Poisson effect. This higher value should be used in place of E throughout the formulations in the preceding pages (when the misfit strain is generated in all in-plane directions).",11: Coating mechanics,LibreTexts Engineering >> Bookshelves >> Materials Science >> TLP Library I >> 11: Coating mechanics,": coating mechanics: this tlp should provide some insights into the mechanics of bi-layer (coating on substrate) systems. it covers the concept of a misfit strain and the way in which equilibrium is established after its introduction, including the creation of curvature. the differences between ""thin"" and ""thick"" coating cases are explained.. this is the topic tree libretexts engineering >> bookshelves >> materials science >> tlp library i >> : coating mechanics",html5

adhesion does not have to be mobilized fully if the wedge is static, the external friction angle δ, since also the external friction does not have to be fully mobilized, and the wedge angle θ. these  additional unknowns require  additional conditions in order to solve the problem. one additional condition is the equilibrium of moments of the wedge, a second condition the principle of minimum required cutting energy. a third condition is found by assuming that the external shear stress (adhesion) and the external shear angle (external friction) are mobilized by the same amount. depending on whether the soil pushes upwards or downwards against the blade, the mobilization factor is between - and +. now in practice, sand and rock have no adhesion while clay has no external friction, so in these cases the third condition is not relevant. however in mixed soil both the external shear stress and the external friction may be present.  the force  on the bottom of the wedge is now:  \[\ \begin{array}{left} \mathrm{k}{}&= \frac{-\mathrm{w}{} \cdot \sin (\alpha+\delta-\theta)+\mathrm{w}{} \cdot \sin (\alpha+\delta)+\mathrm{w}{} \cdot \sin (\delta)}{\sin (\alpha+\delta+\varphi)}

title of the content is .: theforceequilibrium","Figure 10-2 illustrates the forces on the layer of soil cut. The forces shown are valid in general for each type of soil.

The forces acting on the layer A-B are:

A normal force acting on the shear surface N1, resulting from the effective grain stresses.

A shear force S1 as a result of internal friction N1·tan(φ).

A force W1 as a result of water under pressure in the shear zone.

A shear force C1 as a result of pure cohesion \(\ \tau_\mathrm{c}\) or shear strength. This force can be calculated by multiplying the cohesive shear strength \(\ \tau_\mathrm{c}\) with the area of the shear plane.

A gravity force G1 as a result of the weight of the layer cut.

An inertial force I, resulting from acceleration of the soil.

A force normal to the pseudo blade N2, resulting from the effective grain stresses.

A shear force S2 as a result of the soil/soil friction N2·tan(λ) between the layer cut and the wedge pseudo blade. The friction angle λ does not have to be equal to the internal friction angle φ in the shear plane, since the soil has already been deformed.

A shear force C2 as a result of the mobilized cohesion between the soil and the wedge \(\ \tau_\mathrm{c}\). This force can be calculated by multiplying the cohesive shear strength \(\ \tau_\mathrm{c}\) of the soil with the contact area between the soil and the wedge.

A force W2 as a result of water under pressure on the wedge.

The normal force N1 and the shear force S1 can be combined to a resulting grain force K1.

\[\ \mathrm{K}_{1}=\sqrt{\mathrm{N}_{1}^{2}+\mathrm{S}_{1}^{2}}\tag{10-1}\]

The forces acting on the wedge front or pseudo blade A-C when cutting soil, can be distinguished as:

A force normal to the blade N2, resulting from the effective grain stresses.

A shear force S2 as a result of the soil/soil friction N2·tan(λ) between the layer cut and the wedge pseudo blade. The friction angle λ does not have to be equal to the internal friction angle φ in the shear plane, since the soil has already been deformed.

A shear force C2 as a result of the cohesion between the layer cut and the pseudo blade \(\ \tau_\mathrm{c}\). This force can be  calculated by multiplying the cohesive shear strength \(\ \tau_\mathrm{c}\) of the soil with the contact area between the soil and the pseudo blade.

A force W2 as a result of water under pressure on the pseudo blade A-C.

These forces are shown in Figure 10-3. If the forces N2 and S2 are combined to a resulting force K2 and the adhesive force and the water under pressures are known, then the resulting force K2 is the unknown force on the blade. By taking the horizontal and vertical equilibrium of forces an expression for the force K2 on the blade can be derived.

\[\ \mathrm{K}_{2}=\sqrt{\mathrm{N}_{2}^{2}+\mathrm{S}_{2}^{2}}\tag{10-2}\]

The forces acting on the wedge bottom A-D when cutting soil, can be distinguished as:

A force N3, resulting from the effective grain stresses, between the wedge bottom and the undisturbed soil.

A shear force S3 as a result of the soil/soil friction N3·tan(φ) between the wedge bottom and the undisturbed soil.

A shear force C3 as a result of the cohesion between the wedge bottom and the undisturbed soil \(\ \tau_\mathrm{c}\). This force can be calculated by multiplying the cohesive shear strength \(\ \tau_\mathrm{c}\) of the soil with the contact area between the wedge bottom and the undisturbed soil.

A force W3 as a result of water under pressure on the wedge bottom A-D.

The normal force N3 and the shear force S3 can be combined to a resulting grain force K3.

\[\ \mathrm{K}_{3}=\sqrt{\mathrm{N}_{3}^{2}+\mathrm{S}_{3}^{2}}\tag{10-3}\]

The forces acting on a straight blade C-D when cutting soil (see Figure 10-4), can be distinguished as:

A force normal to the blade N4, resulting from the effective grain stresses.

A shear force S4 as a result of the soil/steel friction N4·tan(δ).

A shear force A as a result of pure adhesion between the soil and the blade \(\ \tau_\mathrm{a}\). This force can be calculated by multiplying the adhesive shear strength \(\ \tau_\mathrm{a}\) of the soil with the contact area between the soil and the blade.

The normal force N4 and the shear force S4 can be combined to a resulting grain force K4.

\[\ \mathrm{K}_{4}=\sqrt{\mathrm{N}_{4}^{2}+\mathrm{S}_{4}^{2}}\tag{10-4}\]

The horizontal equilibrium of forces on the layer cut:

\[\ \sum \mathrm{F}_{\mathrm{h}}=\mathrm{K}_{1} \cdot \sin (\beta+\varphi)-\mathrm{W}_{1} \cdot \sin (\beta)+\mathrm{C}_{1} \cdot \cos (\beta)+\mathrm{I} \cdot \cos (\beta) -\mathrm{C}_{2} \cdot \cos (\theta)+\mathrm{W}_{2} \cdot \sin (\theta)-\mathrm{K}_{2} \cdot \sin (\theta+\lambda)=\mathrm{0}\tag{10-5}\]

The vertical equilibrium of forces on the layer cut:

\[\ \sum \mathrm{F}_{\mathrm{v}}=-\mathrm{K}_{1} \cdot \cos (\beta+\varphi)+\mathrm{W}_{1} \cdot \cos (\beta)+\mathrm{C}_{1} \cdot \sin (\beta)+\mathrm{I} \cdot \sin (\beta)+\mathrm{G}_{1}+\mathrm{C}_{2} \cdot \sin (\theta)+\mathrm{W}_{2} \cdot \cos (\theta)-\mathrm{K}_{2} \cdot \cos (\theta+\lambda)=\mathrm{0} \tag{10-6}\]

The force K1 on the shear plane is now:

\[\  \mathrm{K}_{1}= \frac{\mathrm{W}_{2} \cdot \sin (\lambda)+\mathrm{W}_{1} \cdot \sin (\theta+\beta+\lambda)+\mathrm{G}_{1} \cdot \sin (\theta+\lambda)-\mathrm{I} \cdot \cos (\theta+\beta+\lambda)}{\sin (\theta+\beta+\lambda+\varphi)} +\frac{-\mathrm{C}_{1} \cdot \cos (\theta+\beta+\lambda)+\mathrm{C}_{2} \cdot \cos (\lambda)}{\sin (\theta+\beta+\lambda+\varphi)}\tag{10-7} \]

The force K2 on the pseudo blade is now:

\[\ \mathrm{K}_{2}= \frac{\mathrm{W}_{2} \cdot \sin (\theta+\beta+\varphi)+\mathrm{W}_{1} \cdot \sin (\varphi)+\mathrm{G}_{1} \cdot \sin (\beta+\varphi)+\mathrm{I} \cdot \cos (\varphi)}{\sin (\theta+\beta+\lambda+\varphi)} +\frac{+\mathrm{C}_{1} \cdot \cos (\varphi)-\mathrm{C}_{2} \cdot \cos (\theta+\beta+\varphi)}{\sin (\theta+\beta+\lambda+\varphi)} \tag{10-8}\]

From equation (10-8) the forces on the pseudo blade can be derived. On the pseudo blade a force component in the direction of cutting velocity Fh and a force perpendicular to this direction Fv can be distinguished.

\[\ \mathrm{F_{h}=-W_{2} \cdot \sin (\theta)+K_{2} \cdot \sin (\theta+\lambda)+C_{2} \cdot \cos (\theta)}\tag{10-9}\]

\[\ \mathrm{F}_{v}=-\mathrm{W}_{2} \cdot \cos (\theta)+\mathrm{K}_{2} \cdot \cos (\theta+\lambda)-\mathrm{C}_{2} \cdot \sin (\theta)\tag{10-10}\]

The normal force on the shear plane is now:

\[\  \mathrm{N}_{1}= \frac{\mathrm{W}_{2} \cdot \sin (\lambda)+\mathrm{W}_{1} \cdot \sin (\theta+\beta+\lambda)+\mathrm{G}_{1} \cdot \sin (\theta+\lambda)}{\sin (\theta+\beta+\lambda+\varphi)} \cdot \cos (\varphi) +\frac{-\mathrm{I} \cdot \cos (\theta+\beta+\lambda)-\mathrm{C}_{1} \cdot \cos (\theta+\beta+\lambda)+\mathrm{C}_{2} \cdot \cos (\lambda)}{\sin (\theta+\beta+\lambda+\varphi)} \cdot \cos (\varphi)\tag{10-11}\]

The normal force on the pseudo blade is now:

\[\ \mathrm{N}_{2}= \frac{\mathrm{W}_{2} \cdot \sin (\theta+\beta+\varphi)+\mathrm{W}_{1} \cdot \sin (\varphi)+\mathrm{G}_{1} \cdot \sin (\beta+\varphi)}{\sin (\theta+\beta+\lambda+\varphi)} \cdot \cos (\lambda) +\frac{+\mathrm{I} \cdot \cos (\varphi)+\mathrm{C}_{1} \cdot \cos (\varphi)-\mathrm{C}_{2} \cdot \cos (\theta+\beta+\varphi)}{\sin (\theta+\beta+\lambda+\varphi)} \cdot \cos (\lambda)\tag{10-12} \]

Now knowing the forces on the pseudo blade A-C, the equilibrium of forces on the wedge A-C-D can be derived. The horizontal equilibrium of forces on the wedge is:

\[\  \sum \mathrm{F}_{\mathrm{h}}=-\mathrm{A} \cdot \cos (\alpha)+\mathrm{W}_{4} \cdot \sin (\alpha)-\mathrm{K}_{4} \cdot \sin (\alpha+\delta)+\mathrm{K}_{3} \cdot \sin (\varphi) +\mathrm{C}_{3}-\mathrm{W}_{2} \cdot \sin (\theta)+\mathrm{C}_{2} \cdot \cos (\theta)+\mathrm{K}_{2} \cdot \sin (\theta+\lambda)=\mathrm{0} \tag{10-13}\]

The vertical equilibrium of forces on the wedge is:

\[\ \sum \mathrm{F}_{\mathrm{v}}=\mathrm{A} \cdot \sin (\alpha)+\mathrm{W}_{4} \cdot \cos (\alpha)-\mathrm{K}_{4} \cdot \cos (\alpha+\delta)+\mathrm{W}_{3}-\mathrm{K}_{3} \cdot \cos (\varphi) -\mathrm{W}_{2} \cdot \cos (\theta)-\mathrm{C}_{2} \cdot \sin (\theta)+\mathrm{K}_{2} \cdot \cos (\theta+\lambda)+\mathrm{G}_{2}=\mathrm{0}\tag{10-14}\]

The unknowns in this equation are K3 and K4, since K2 has already been solved. Three other unknowns are the adhesive force on the blade A, since the adhesion does not have to be mobilized fully if the wedge is static, the external friction angle δ, since also the external friction does not have to be fully mobilized, and the wedge angle θ. These 3 additional unknowns require 3 additional conditions in order to solve the problem. One additional condition is the equilibrium of moments of the wedge, a second condition the principle of minimum required cutting energy. A third condition is found by assuming that the external shear stress (adhesion) and the external shear angle (external friction) are mobilized by the same amount. Depending on whether the soil pushes upwards or downwards against the blade, the mobilization factor is between -1 and +1. Now in practice, sand and rock have no adhesion while clay has no external friction, so in these cases the third condition is not relevant. However in mixed soil both the external shear stress and the external friction may be present.

The force K3 on the bottom of the wedge is now:

\[\ \begin{array}{left} \mathrm{K}_{3}&= \frac{-\mathrm{W}_{2} \cdot \sin (\alpha+\delta-\theta)+\mathrm{W}_{3} \cdot \sin (\alpha+\delta)+\mathrm{W}_{4} \cdot \sin (\delta)}{\sin (\alpha+\delta+\varphi)} \\&+\frac{\mathrm{K}_{2} \cdot \sin (\alpha+\delta-\theta-\lambda)+\mathrm{G}_{2} \cdot \sin (\alpha+\delta)}{\sin (\alpha+\delta+\varphi)}  \\&+\frac{\mathrm{A} \cdot \cos (\delta)+\mathrm{C}_{3} \cdot \cos (\alpha+\delta)-\mathrm{C}_{2} \cdot \cos (\alpha+\delta-\theta)}{\sin (\alpha+\delta+\varphi)} & \end{array}\tag{10-15}\]

The force K4 on the blade is now:

\[\ \begin{array}{left} \mathrm{K}_{4}=& \frac{-\mathrm{W}_{2} \cdot \sin (\theta+\varphi)+\mathrm{W}_{3} \cdot \sin (\varphi)+\mathrm{W}_{4} \cdot \sin (\alpha+\varphi)+\mathrm{K}_{2} \cdot \sin (\theta+\lambda+\varphi)+\mathrm{G}_{2} \cdot \sin (\varphi)}{\sin (\alpha+\delta+\varphi)} \\ &+\frac{-\mathrm{A} \cdot \cos (\alpha+\varphi)+\mathrm{C}_{3} \cdot \cos (\varphi)+\mathrm{C}_{2} \cdot \cos (\theta+\varphi)}{\sin (\alpha+\delta+\varphi)} \end{array}\tag{10-16}\]

This results in a horizontal force of:

\[\ \mathrm{F}_{\mathrm{h}}=-\mathrm{W}_{\mathrm{4}} \cdot \sin (\alpha)+\mathrm{K}_{4} \cdot \sin (\alpha+\delta)+\mathrm{A} \cdot \cos (\alpha)\tag{10-17}\]

And in a vertical force of:

\[\ \mathrm{F}_{\mathrm{v}}=-\mathrm{W}_{\mathrm{4}} \cdot \cos (\alpha)+\mathrm{K}_{4} \cdot \cos (\alpha+\delta)-\mathrm{A} \cdot \sin (\alpha)\tag{10-18}\]

it feels like it's semantic, which is really debating around the meaning of words. but, at the end of the roman empire and as we get into the middle ages, this was a major issue of philosophical and it would sometimes bleed over into political debate. and so constantine, who we mentioned has a sympathy towards the christians, he allows christianity to be tolerated, he does not like this idea of this debate and he wants to help unify the christians. so, in  he calls the council of nicaea, to help resolve this controversy, which gets known as the arian controversy, named after arius of alexandria. now it's worth mentioning, arius wasn't the first person to make this argument, that the father in some way was more divine than the son, because he begat the son, he existed before the son. but this controversy really revolves around arius, because he was especially persuasive about spreading this view of the relationship between the father and the son, manifested by jesus. and at the council of nicaea, many of the bishops throughout christendom are in attendance, it's known as the first ecumenical conference, the word ecumenical comes from the greek word for the inhabited earth. so you can view it as the church leaders from the inhabited earth, in order to create a consensus about what it means to be a christian. and arius of alexandria was there to defend his position, but the majority of those there did not like his point of view. so they declared arius' beliefs as heresy and they exile him. and to be very clear that they do not believe that the son is of a different substance of the father, they issue the nicene creed. so what i have here, this is known as the nicene-constantinopolitan creed. and this is based on the nicene creed, which was established in , which was shorter, but then in , under theodosius, you have your second ecumenical council, which is held in constantinople, to reaffirm some of the ideas of the nicene council. and so as i read this, keep a look out for some of these words, which were really put there to try to settle the arian controversy, to try to ensure that that type of belief does not surface again. we believe in one god, the father almighty, maker of heaven and earth, and of all things visible and invisible. and in one lord jesus christ, the son of god, the only-begotten, begotten of the father before all ages. so, not like arius was arguing, that there was a time where the father existed before the son existed. here it says begotten of the father, but before all ages, so there was always a time when there was a son. light of light, very god of very god, begotten, not made; of one essence with the father, by whom all things were made. so, once again, really addressing this arian controversy, the arian heresy as it becomes known, that the father and the son are of the same essence, one is not more divine than the other. who for us men and for our salvation came down from heaven, and was incarnate of the holy spirit and the virgin mary, and was made man. and was crucified also for us under pontius pilate, and suffered, and was buried. and the third day he rose again, according to the scriptures. and ascended into heaven, and sits at the right hand of the father. and he shall come again with glory to judge the living and the dead, whose kingdom shall have no end. and we believe in the holy spirit, the lord, and giver of life, who proceeds from the father. now here in brackets i've written filoque and the son? because even though the official nicene- constantinopolitan creed just says who proceeds from the father, as we will see later on, as the church starts to become more and more divided, in the west, in latin, the term filoque gets added, which means and the son. and, once again, this is starting to address this notion of how does the son relate to the father? so, when you add filoque, you're saying, hey, the holy spirit is emanating from both the father and the son, versus just the father, but we'll get into that. this was not a matter of debate in the  century, but it will become a matter of debate as we go into the  century and beyond. and we believe in the holy spirit, the lord, and giver of life, who proceeds from the father. who with the father and the son together is worshiped and glorified, who spoke by the prophets. and we believe in one, holy, catholic, meaning universal, and apostolic church. we acknowledge one baptism for the remission of sins. we look for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the age to come, amen. so this is interesting, because it's, you can view it as a unification of christendom. now, as we will see, that unification does not hold well over the next several hundred years. even though arius is exiled and he dies shortly thereafter, you continue to have sympathetic bishops and even roman emperors, to the arian doctrine. you also, this debate between the relation of the father and the son continues, we'll talk about this filoque debate. but maybe most important and the biggest cause of the eventual divisions between the church, ones that carry on even to today, it's really about a power struggle. so, as we've been talking about the late roman empire and even the fall of the western empire and the beginning of the byzantine empire, you might already notice that there are several very powerful actors here. with the fall of the western roman empire, you have the byzantine emperor, who considers him, and as we'll see, also herself, the roman emperor. we have the bishop, the patriarch, or, often known, the pope of rome. now rome is significant, because according to tradition the church at rome was founded by the apostle peter, who is considered by many to be the first amongst the apostles. but of course rome was the seat of the roman empire for a very, very, very long time. and so you could imagine the bishop of the church of rome, the pope of rome would be a very powerful figure. now you also have the bishop or the patriarch of constantinople, which is another capital and really the capital of the byzantine empire. and so what we're going to see, over the next several hundred years, is the jockeying for position amongst these three, in particular the byzantine emperor and the pope of rome. the pope of rome starts to consider themselves as really the leader of all of christendom. the patriarch of constantinople and the bishops of the other major centers of christianity, like antioch and jerusalem and alexandria, they view themselves as all kind of a college of, as peers and they will give extra space for the pope of rome or the bishop of rome, because of the importance of that city and the significance of how the church of rome was founded. and this gets, this jockeying for power over the next several hundred years gets even more complex as the west, what was the western roman empire, or some of the areas of the western roman empire, start to get consolidated under germanic rule really, frankish rule and you start having this notion of a holy roman emperor that we'll talk about in a few hundred years down our timeline. so, keep a look out for this power struggle. we're going to talk about particular issues of theological doctrine, things like the filoque issue, things like the relationship between the father and the son, whether you should have icons. but, at the end of the day, what's eventually going to lead to the great schism, in the beginning of the second millennium, is this power struggle.. the title of the content is the council of nicaea","- [Instructor] In previous videos, we have talked about how Christianity evolved and developed under the Roman Empire. In particular we saw that as we entered into the 4th century, that Christianity continued to be persecuted, in particular by the Emperor Diocletian, who had some of the worst persecutions of the Christians. But over the course of the next century, from roughly 300 to 400, the relationship between the Roman Empire and Christianity goes completely in the opposite direction. As Constantine takes over, he becomes sympathetic to the Christians and he eventually becomes Christian himself. Even then, there was a lot of diversity within the Christian Church. There were debates about the nature of Jesus Christ relative to the Father, relative to the Holy Spirit. There were multiple sects of Christianity. And one in particular started to create a debate. There was a priest in Alexandria, which was one of the major cities of the Roman Empire. Now remember, by this point, Rome of course is one of the most significant, if not the most significant city. Now Constantine sets up a capital at Byzantium, which will eventually be known as Constantinople. And Alexandria, which was originally founded by Alexander the Great, is also one of the significant cities of the Empire. And in Alexandria there is a Christian priest by the name of Arius, who has a view on Christ that becomes a bit of a controversy. And to understand that, here is an account of his writings, or his beliefs. So this is Arius of Alexandria. If the Father begat the Son, he that was begotten had a beginning of existence: and from this it is evident, that there was a time when the Son was not. It therefore necessarily follows that He, the Son, had his substance from nothing. So, he's drawing a distinction between the essence of the Father and the Son, who's manifested as Jesus Christ. Now this is very controversial, because even his own bishop in Alexandria viewed the Father and the Son to be of the same substance. Now, today, you might say, hey, isn't this just word play? It feels like it's semantic, which is really debating around the meaning of words. But, at the end of the Roman Empire and as we get into the Middle Ages, this was a major issue of philosophical and it would sometimes bleed over into political debate. And so Constantine, who we mentioned has a sympathy towards the Christians, he allows Christianity to be tolerated, he does not like this idea of this debate and he wants to help unify the Christians. So, in 325 he calls the Council of Nicaea, to help resolve this controversy, which gets known as the Arian Controversy, named after Arius of Alexandria. Now it's worth mentioning, Arius wasn't the first person to make this argument, that the Father in some way was more divine than the Son, because He begat the Son, He existed before the Son. But this controversy really revolves around Arius, because he was especially persuasive about spreading this view of the relationship between the Father and the Son, manifested by Jesus. And at the Council of Nicaea, many of the bishops throughout Christendom are in attendance, it's known as the First Ecumenical Conference, the word ecumenical comes from the Greek word for the inhabited Earth. So you can view it as the Church leaders from the inhabited Earth, in order to create a consensus about what it means to be a Christian. And Arius of Alexandria was there to defend his position, but the majority of those there did not like his point of view. So they declared Arius' beliefs as heresy and they exile him. And to be very clear that they do not believe that the Son is of a different substance of the Father, they issue the Nicene Creed. So what I have here, this is known as the Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed. And this is based on the Nicene Creed, which was established in 325, which was shorter, but then in 381, under Theodosius, you have your Second Ecumenical Council, which is held in Constantinople, to reaffirm some of the ideas of the Nicene Council. And so as I read this, keep a look out for some of these words, which were really put there to try to settle the Arian Controversy, to try to ensure that that type of belief does not surface again. We believe in one God, the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth, and of all things visible and invisible. And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the Only-begotten, Begotten of the Father before all ages. So, not like Arius was arguing, that there was a time where the Father existed before the Son existed. Here it says begotten of the Father, but before all ages, so there was always a time when there was a Son. Light of Light, Very God of Very God, Begotten, not made; of one essence with the Father, by whom all things were made. So, once again, really addressing this Arian Controversy, the Arian Heresy as it becomes known, that the Father and the Son are of the same essence, one is not more divine than the other. Who for us men and for our salvation came down from heaven, and was incarnate of the Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary, and was made man. And was crucified also for us under Pontius Pilate, and suffered, and was buried. And the third day He rose again, according to the Scriptures. And ascended into heaven, and sits at the right hand of the Father. And He shall come again with glory to judge the living and the dead, Whose kingdom shall have no end. And we believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, and Giver of Life, Who proceeds from the Father. Now here in brackets I've written filoque and the son? Because even though the official Nicene- Constantinopolitan Creed just says Who proceeds from the Father, as we will see later on, as the Church starts to become more and more divided, in the West, in Latin, the term filoque gets added, which means and the son. And, once again, this is starting to address this notion of how does the Son relate to the Father? So, when you add filoque, you're saying, hey, the Holy Spirit is emanating from both the Father and the Son, versus just the Father, but we'll get into that. This was not a matter of debate in the 4th century, but it will become a matter of debate as we go into the 6th century and beyond. And we believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, and Giver of Life, Who proceeds from the Father. Who with the Father and the Son together is worshiped and glorified, Who spoke by the Prophets. And we believe in one, holy, catholic, meaning universal, and apostolic Church. We acknowledge one Baptism for the remission of sins. We look for the Resurrection of the dead, and the life of the age to come, Amen. So this is interesting, because it's, you can view it as a unification of Christendom. Now, as we will see, that unification does not hold well over the next several hundred years. Even though Arius is exiled and he dies shortly thereafter, you continue to have sympathetic bishops and even Roman Emperors, to the Arian Doctrine. You also, this debate between the relation of the Father and the Son continues, we'll talk about this filoque debate. But maybe most important and the biggest cause of the eventual divisions between the Church, ones that carry on even to today, it's really about a power struggle. So, as we've been talking about the late Roman Empire and even the fall of the Western Empire and the beginning of the Byzantine Empire, you might already notice that there are several very powerful actors here. With the fall of the Western Roman Empire, you have the Byzantine Emperor, who considers him, and as we'll see, also herself, the Roman Emperor. We have the Bishop, the Patriarch, or, often known, the Pope of Rome. Now Rome is significant, because according to tradition the Church at Rome was founded by the Apostle Peter, who is considered by many to be the first amongst the Apostles. But of course Rome was the seat of the Roman Empire for a very, very, very long time. And so you could imagine the Bishop of the Church of Rome, the Pope of Rome would be a very powerful figure. Now you also have the Bishop or the Patriarch of Constantinople, which is another capital and really the capital of the Byzantine Empire. And so what we're going to see, over the next several hundred years, is the jockeying for position amongst these three, in particular the Byzantine Emperor and the Pope of Rome. The Pope of Rome starts to consider themselves as really the leader of all of Christendom. The Patriarch of Constantinople and the bishops of the other major centers of Christianity, like Antioch and Jerusalem and Alexandria, they view themselves as all kind of a college of, as peers and they will give extra space for the Pope of Rome or the Bishop of Rome, because of the importance of that city and the significance of how the Church of Rome was founded. And this gets, this jockeying for power over the next several hundred years gets even more complex as the West, what was the Western Roman Empire, or some of the areas of the Western Roman Empire, start to get consolidated under Germanic rule really, Frankish rule and you start having this notion of a Holy Roman Emperor that we'll talk about in a few hundred years down our timeline. So, keep a look out for this power struggle. We're going to talk about particular issues of theological doctrine, things like the filoque issue, things like the relationship between the Father and the Son, whether you should have icons. But, at the end of the day, what's eventually going to lead to the Great Schism, in the beginning of the Second Millennium, is this power struggle.",Early Christianity,Khan Academy (English - CBSE India Curriculum) >> Arts and humanities >> World history >> 600 BCE - 600 CE Second-Wave Civilizations >> Early Christianity,"christianity starts as a jewish sect on the periphery of the roman empire. despite being actively persecuted, the religion grows through the empire, eventually becoming the official state religion.. this is the topic tree khan academy (english - cbse india curriculum) >> arts and humanities >> world history >>  bce -  ce second-wave civilizations >> early christianity",video

from the time of jesus to the reign of theodosius.  . - [narrator] as we've talked about in multiple videos, christianity is a religion that grew out of the fringes of the roman empire. it starts as a jewish sect in judea and galilee with the teachings of jesus and his early ministry. but it's important to keep in mind that at the time of jesus's crucifixion, around  c.e., he only had, at most, we're talking about in the hundreds of followers. but in other videos, we talk about his apostles who start spreading the faith, not only to other jews, but also to non-jews, to gentiles. we talked about emperor nero and his famous purges of christians, in particular, you have the famous roman fire, or the fire of rome in  c.e. that nero blames on christians, and he uses this to do significant purge in rome. many historians believe that the apostles peter and paul were killed during those purges. this is a painting of nero using christians lighting them alive to punish them for that fire. now, other imperial acts that continue to have a significant effect on this very early christian church. we talked about the destroying of the second temple in jerusalem in  c.e., and that's under the reign of vespasian. and this of course is a very significant event for the jewish people, but it also has a significant effect on christianity, because remember christianity was really centered at jerusalem. it was a sect of christianity, or it was, it got its start as a sect of christianity, but now, with the destruction of the temple, the jews were dispersed from jerusalem, and so were many of these early christians. and so the centers of christianity became throughout the empire, places like antioch. and you continue to have a discomfort with christians especially as they became more and more in number, and they started to have more and more power. and here you have these people who refused to obey the roman gods, to do their rituals, to worship the roman gods, and remember, even, there was emperor worship here. and the issue was more so than even the jewish people, who, to a certain degree, kept to themselves, these christians were missionaries. they were spreading their faith to roman citizens. families were being split apart, where some decided to become christians and no longer follow these roman practices. and so you have these various persecutions, and these various purges, and they get more and more significant as you go into the second and even to some degree in the third century as christians become more and more prominent and more and more in number. remember, they have this missionary zeal, and it really becomes a significant purge under the reign of diocletian. in previous videos, we talk about diocletian. he's the one that famously split the empire between east and west, but he's also famous for his purge of the christians. the most extreme state-sponsored purges of christians in the roman empire. but what's interesting is right after, or shortly after those purges, we're talking a few decades here, the next empire that would, the next emperor who would have reign over the entire roman empire, would be constantine, and at least relative to christians, he would be the opposite of diocletian, because as he's trying to consolidate his power in  c.e., you have the famous battle at the milvian bridge outside of, or entering into rome. and in this battle, constantine, he sees a vision of the christian cross centered on the sun, and he thinks that that is a sign that he should fight under the cross. and he gets the symbols painted on his soldier's sealed, and he's victorious. this date, , milvian bridge, the battle at milvian bridge, is viewed as the beginning of constantine's conversion to christianity, viewing it as his chosen faith. in , the roman emperor, or the empire, issues the edict of milan, which officially makes christianity ok. it legalizes christianity, which is a big deal, because these folks have been persecuted all this time. they haven't been worshiping the roman gods. then in , constantine goes even further, and he convenes the council of nicea, where he brings the bishops from all of christendom together, to start having a more unified belief system. they come up with a nicean creed. a lot of the debate is whether jesus, as son of god, should be considered equal to god or as god or a little less, as being the son, maybe if he is the son, maybe there was a time where there wasn't a son, and there was just god, but the nicean creed says no, they are one and the same, these two things are equivalent. and then constantine, on his death bed, famously gets baptized, and becomes a christian, the first christian emperor of this gigantic roman empire. and so you can imagine, you have more and more followers of christianity, but now, this is, so to speak, prime time. the emperor of the roman, the emperor of the roman empire has converted to christianity, and it's a legalized religion. and then that gets even more momentum when we get to the end of the fourth century. emperor theodosius, who is christian, under him, it becomes the official religion of the roman empire, the same empire that at one point, christianity was illegal, and it was being persecuted, now it was the official religion of the roman empire. theodosius, i mention him in other videos, he was incidentally also the last emperor to rule over both eastern and western roman empires. so you have this empire that starts off very anti-christian, actually in the beginning, they don't really take much note of what's going on in judea and galilee, but more and more, they start to persecute them. but we go a few hundred years into this, and it becomes a christian empire.. the title of the

It starts as a Jewish sect in Judea and Galilee with the teachings of Jesus and his early ministry. But it's important to keep in mind that at the time of Jesus's crucifixion, around 30 C.E., he only had, at most, we're talking about in the hundreds of followers. But in other videos, we talk about his apostles who start spreading the faith, not only to other Jews, but also to non-Jews, to gentiles. We talked about Emperor Nero and his famous purges of Christians, in particular, you have the famous Roman Fire, or The Fire of Rome in 64 C.E. that Nero blames on Christians, and he uses this to do significant purge in Rome. Many historians believe that the apostles Peter and Paul were killed during those purges. This is a painting of Nero using Christians lighting them alive to punish them for that fire.

now, charlemagne considers himself something of a protector of christianity, and pope leo iii goes to him for protection, and charlemagne is able to actually provide it. and in exchange, or perhaps in thanks for that, the pope crowns charlemagne as holy roman emperor. now, what's significant about this is it really introduces a fourth actor here, because the title holy roman emperor was intentionally given to say, look, now you, charlemagne, you are the heir to the grandeur of rome. you are the heir to the roman emperors. now, you might be saying, wait, isn't that what the byzantine emperors thought they were? didn't they think this was the roman empire? and at that time, their emperor was an empress. it was empress irene of athens. and so once again, this is creating further tension. they're using different languages, latin versus greek. you now have the western pope recognizing a different, i guess you could say, roman emperor in charlemagne. the nature of the west is becoming more germanic, and using the language latin, while the nature of the east is continuing in greek traditions. on top of that, what you have in the year , you're actually in this period where you've had several conflicts over this notion of iconoclasm. this iconoclasm movement, you could say, started in  when the byzantine emperor said, enough of these images of jesus and the virgin mary and other figures of christianity in our churches, citing references in the old testament saying that hey, we shouldn't have these images. and so this iconoclasm or these destroying of icons starts to begin. well, the pope in the west, they say, hey, we don't think we have to listen to you. i am the bishop of rome. i have universal jurisdiction. and then to add insult to injury, now, in , you have charlemagne being crowned holy roman emperor. now, a thread further running through this is something we've talked about in a previous video, this notion of filioque, where in , the council of constantinople, they augment the nicene creed where they say, and we believe in the holy spirit, the lord and giver of life who proceeds from the father. well, in the west, they add the latin term filioque, which means and the son. this is touching on some of these notions in the arian heresy where, where does the holy spirit proceed from, if the father and son are really co-divine, co-equal, of the same substance, shouldn't the holy spirit proceed from both rather than just one? well, those in the east said, hey, this isn't what we agreed to, while those in the west say, hey, we don't think it's so important that you agree to things, because we have the seat at rome, the seat that was established by peter.. the title of the content is great schism or east-west schism part ","- [Instructor] In previous videos, we talked about the dramatic turnaround in the fourth century in terms of how Christianity was treated in the Roman Empire. As you enter into the fourth century, it's persecuted by Diocletian, but then Constantine takes power. He's sympathetic to the Christians. He even convenes them in order to unify the Christians, to have a more unified sense of what it means to be Christian, in order to settle things like the Arian Controversy, and he converts himself to Christianity. And as we exit the fourth century, you have Theodosius, who makes Christianity the official religion of the Roman Empire and then begins to persecute other religions. Now, what we're going to do in this video is continue the narrative, and in particular, we're going to see how there's an evolution between the church in the west and the church in the east. In previous videos, we already talk about how the Roman Empire itself is initially administered between west and east, and then that administration becomes more and more formal. Theodosius is the last emperor to truly rule both halves. They start getting ruled separately. And as you get into the latter half of the fifth century, the western empire itself falls to Germanic conquerors. Now, in previous videos, we talk about how the emperors who rule from Constantinople consider themselves to continue the Roman Empire. They didn't call themselves the Byzantine Empire, as we now call them. They call themselves the Roman Empire. They considered themselves Roman emperors. The west falls, as I just mentioned, into a bunch of Germanic kingdoms. Justinian is able to reclaim a lot of the land formerly lost in the western Roman Empire. Now, there's some other interesting actors we see emerging on this map, and once again, we're now in the sixth century. You have these Germanic tribes, the Visigothic kingdoms here in modern-day Spain, and here in modern-day France, you have the Franks. And the word France really is referring to land of the Franks, another Germanic tribe. Now, they are able to factor much, much more relevantly. And when I say about, I'm saying over the next several hundred years in this eventual division, culturally and religiously, between east and west. As I mentioned in previous videos, the division, yes, it will center on notions of language. In the west, especially in the church, Latin is used. In the east, in the church, Greek is used. There are spiritual debates that we will touch on in a few minutes, but there's also a power struggle. You have the Byzantine Emperor seated in Constantinople. You have the Bishop of Rome, now known as the Pope, the Pope of Rome, who considers themselves more and more the leader of all of Christianity, and their argument there is look, this is the church that, according to tradition, was founded by Peter, first amongst the apostles. You have the patriarch of Constantinople and patriarchs of other significant centers of Christianity that say wait, hold on a second. Yes, Bishop of Rome, you are very important. But we consider you to be first amongst equals. You don't have jurisdiction over all of Christendom. Together we have jurisdiction. And this was, to some degree, the case under Justinian, and it was very clear at this time that the Byzantine emperor was very powerful, not just over the temporal realm, really referring to the day-to-day material realm, but also a lot of influence on the spiritual realm, which was really supposed to be the domain of the bishops or the popes or the patriarchs. This notion of the pentarchy was codified in the Justinian law, this idea that these five centers of Christianity really have extra weight and collectively are really leading Christendom. Now, as I mentioned, things get interesting as we fast forward about 250 years. So let's go to the year 800. So, one thing you might notice is that group in yellow, the Franks, have now conquered a lot more, and they're conquering it under the leadership of Charlemagne. At the same time, you see this green over here. Islam has dramatically spread from its founding in the early seventh century, all the way now as we're exiting the eighth century, to cover most of the Middle East, Persia, bordering on modern-day Pakistan, India, north Africa, and even going into modern-day Spain. At the same time, especially because of these Islamic conquests, the Byzantine Empire and the Byzantine emperor is significantly weaker. So you can imagine the pope in Rome here saying, well, who's going to protect me, especially from my political enemies? Now, Charlemagne considers himself something of a protector of Christianity, and Pope Leo III goes to him for protection, and Charlemagne is able to actually provide it. And in exchange, or perhaps in thanks for that, the pope crowns Charlemagne as Holy Roman Emperor. Now, what's significant about this is it really introduces a fourth actor here, because the title Holy Roman Emperor was intentionally given to say, look, now you, Charlemagne, you are the heir to the grandeur of Rome. You are the heir to the Roman emperors. Now, you might be saying, wait, isn't that what the Byzantine emperors thought they were? Didn't they think this was the Roman Empire? And at that time, their emperor was an empress. It was Empress Irene of Athens. And so once again, this is creating further tension. They're using different languages, Latin versus Greek. You now have the western pope recognizing a different, I guess you could say, Roman emperor in Charlemagne. The nature of the west is becoming more Germanic, and using the language Latin, while the nature of the east is continuing in Greek traditions. On top of that, what you have in the year 800, you're actually in this period where you've had several conflicts over this notion of iconoclasm. This iconoclasm movement, you could say, started in 726 when the Byzantine emperor said, enough of these images of Jesus and the Virgin Mary and other figures of Christianity in our churches, citing references in the Old Testament saying that hey, we shouldn't have these images. And so this iconoclasm or these destroying of icons starts to begin. Well, the pope in the west, they say, hey, we don't think we have to listen to you. I am the Bishop of Rome. I have universal jurisdiction. And then to add insult to injury, now, in 800, you have Charlemagne being crowned Holy Roman Emperor. Now, a thread further running through this is something we've talked about in a previous video, this notion of filioque, where in 381, the Council of Constantinople, they augment the Nicene Creed where they say, and we believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord and Giver of Life who proceeds from the Father. Well, in the west, they add the Latin term filioque, which means and the Son. This is touching on some of these notions in the Arian Heresy where, where does the Holy Spirit proceed from, if the Father and Son are really co-divine, co-equal, of the same substance, shouldn't the Holy Spirit proceed from both rather than just one? Well, those in the east said, hey, this isn't what we agreed to, while those in the west say, hey, we don't think it's so important that you agree to things, because we have the seat at Rome, the seat that was established by Peter.",Early Christianity,Khan Academy (English - CBSE India Curriculum) >> Arts and humanities >> World history >> 600 BCE - 600 CE Second-Wave Civilizations >> Early Christianity,"christianity starts as a jewish sect on the periphery of the roman empire. despite being actively persecuted, the religion grows through the empire, eventually becoming the official state religion.. this is the topic tree khan academy (english - cbse india curriculum) >> arts and humanities >> world history >>  bce -  ce second-wave civilizations >> early christianity",video

[instructor] we're now going to talk about the beginnings of one of the most important religions in human history. and, even today, the largest religion on earth. and that, of course, is christianity. and the central figure in christianity is jesus christ. and the term christ is given to him. it is greek for savior, for messiah. because his early followers view him as the prophesized messiah, savior, for the jewish people. and his followers today view him as the savior, the messiah, for all humankind. so, you have over two billion christians who view him central to their faith. who view him as their god. but, above and beyond that, you also have over a billion muslims who view him as a significant prophet. now, just to get some context on the life and times of jesus, most of the accounts we have of him come from the first four books of the new testament of the bible called the gospel of matthew, gospel of mark, gospel of luke, gospel of john. sometimes it's the gospel according to matthew, mark, luke, or john. and the term gospel today often refers to the idea of the life and teaching of jesus christ. so, you could view it as the life and teaching of jesus christ according to matthew, according to mark, according to luke, according to john. but it really comes from old english for good news. and there is a related term, evangel. you might have heard of evangelical or evangelize. also referring to good news. now, the reason why it was considered good news is his message.... we're gonna have some examples of it in a few minutes. really talks about this idea that the poor have the kingdom of heaven waiting for them. that there's this forgiving god that you can have a close connection with. and for a lot of people... remember, this was in the time of the roman empire. most people were downtrodden. there was slavery. people who were poor. and this idea that even the poor could go to the kingdom of heaven and, in some ways, have better access to it than the rich and the powerful was good news to a lot of people. now, it's worth noting that these gospels were written several decades after, depending on what you view, the death and/or ascension of jesus christ according to christian belief. as you can see, jesus was born slightly before the year one. most historians put his birth at around four to six bce, before the common era. and they put his death around  to  ce, in the common era. you could also use the original terms, before christ and anno dominei, in the year of our lord. our modern calendar system really uses the original view of the birth of jesus as where we start anno dominei versus before christ or the common era versus before the common era. now, it's interesting that it turns out that jesus was likely born slightly before. slightly before the original view on the birth of christ. now, his birth would have been right around the time... or it would have been under the reign of emperor augustus, as we talk about in other videos. and his death would have been under the reign of emperor tiberius. and these gospels of mark, matthew, luke, and john. these are written during really hard times for the jewish people and for the early christians. you have the jewish rebellion where the second temple is destroyed by rome. you have the significant christian persecution, especially by folks like emperor nero where he blames the fire in rome on christians and he just, essentially, just kills them for fun. really just to purge them, to persecute them. and, just to understand where all of this takes place, the life and times of jesus takes place, it is in the roman empire. we're on the eastern edge of it at the eastern mediterranean right over here. this would be modern day israel and palestine for the most part. this is a zoomed in version. and jesus is born in bethlehem. and this is a scene. i'm gonna show you a lot of paintings. as you can imagine, he's a figure that has inspired a lot of paintings. this is a figure of the three magi visiting and giving their gifts to the infant jesus. magi, famously the zoroastrian priests, coming from persia to visit jesus, according to biblical accounts. and he is raised in nazareth. and that's why he's oftentimes referred to as jesus of nazareth. and the gospels don't talk a lot about his early life. they start to talk a lot about his life once he hits his late 's or early 's. and the first really significant account after his famous birth to the virgin mary. his purported father, joseph, was mary's husband, but the holy ghost or god was the actual father, making this a virgin birth. but, after that, the first significant event is really his baptism by john the baptist. john the baptist was another preacher, prophetic figure of that time. a significant one. he had a lot of followers. and he as baptizing people in the jordan river, right in that region. this is the jordan river right over here. and this is a depiction of the famous baptism of jesus by john the baptist. and, famously, john the baptist said, ""no, you should be baptizing me."" but then after jesus said, ""no, no, you baptize me."" and, after, jesus was baptized. famously the sun shines on jesus and god speaks that ""this is my son."" according to, once again, biblical accounts. and john the baptist, shortly after that, gets arrested by king herod of galilee. remember, galilee is the home region of jesus where he will eventually do most of his preaching. and, after that, jesus starts to really go full into effect in his ministry. and, while he's doing that, he's performing all of these miracles. he's healing people, turning water into wine, walking on water, bringing people back from the dead. and this is, of course, according to biblical accounts. you can decide if you believe these or not. and he does most of that in galilee. and, eventually, he makes his way down to jerusalem to meet his fate. he tells, according to the gospels, his followers, his disciples.... and there's  in particular that are called out, but he has many, many more than that. that ""look, i am going to meet my fate there, but i'm doing it willingly."" but, more than his miracles, it's interesting to look at some of what he preached. and this might give you a little bit of a sense why many people would have called this good news. so, this is from the gospel of matthew that i'm gonna quote right over here. and this first part comes from his sermon of the mount. he goes to the top of a mountain and he gives this sermon. ""blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven."" ""blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth."" ""blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy."" ""blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see god."" ""blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called sons of god."" so, all of that, if you're a peasant, if you're someone with not a lot, you're downtrodden, hard life. you're like, ""look, blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven."" you could view this as good news. ""ye have heard that it was said an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth, but i say unto you, resist not him that is evil. but whosoever smiteth thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also."" even in modern times, this is not an easy way... this is not an easy way to live. someone who's doing something to you, don't try to seek revenge. and this is a very different tone than a lot of what you might get in the old testament. ""ye have heard that it was said, thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy, but i say unto you love your enemies and pray for them that persecute you."" once again, not an easy thing to do. even in modern terms, you can view this as a very forward, very advanced way of thinking about the world. he also, beyond this idea of embracing even your enemies and not seeking revenge and that the poor have access to this kingdom of heaven, he really also liked to take it to the hypocrites, especially those who viewed themselves as the bearers of the religion. in particular, he picks on the pharisees, which was a sect of jews at the time who viewed themselves very ritualistic. remember, jesus, himself, is a jewish preacher. he's a jewish teacher. he is viewed as a rabbi himself. ""and when ye pray, ye shall not be as the hypocrites. for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and in the corners of the street that they may be seen of men."" so, these hypocrites, they pray just so other people can see how religious they are. ""verily, i say unto you, they have received their reward."" they've already gotten the credit from people for praying. ""but thou, when thou prayest, enter into thine inner chamber and, having shut thy door, pray to thy father who is in secret, and thy father, who seeth in secret shall recompense thee."" so, don't make a big deal about your prayer. do it in private and then have this personal connection with god. now, it's worth noting that, even though he preached a lot about the kingdom of heaven for the poor, prayer is a private thing, that you shouldn't try to seek revenge, you should be very conciliatory to your enemies, he did take a strong stance on what he was preaching. he did say, ""look, you gotta be with me if you want to enter into this kingdom of heaven."" he took some strong stances. this isn't gonna be an easy thing and this is gonna cause a lot of tension. this is one quote that you could view that way. once again, from the gospel of matthew, ""think not that i came to send peace on earth. i came not to send peace, but a sword. for i came to set a man at variance against his father and the daughter against her mother."" i would interpret this as saying this is gonna cause a lot of divisiveness. ""and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law. and a man's foes shall be they of his own household. he that loveth father and mother more than me is not worthy of me. and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me. and he that doth not take his cross and follow after me is not worthy of me. he that findeth his life shall lose it and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it."" so, he takes a pretty strong stance. ""look, you really need to follow me. but, if you follow me, there's some very good things that are waiting for you."" but, eventually, he does make his way... he tells his... there's other.... these miracles he's performing. this is the famous transfiguration of christ where he makes it apparent to his followers. he kind of becomes luminescent and he becomes apparent to his followers, his disciples, that he truly is the son of god. and then, he makes his way... this is the year, depending on whether you think it's , , ,  ce. he makes his way to jerusalem to meet his fate. he's already prophesized to his followers that this is gonna be a tough fate. that he's gonna die there. and this is a very important week in christianity. it's referred to as passion week. and the term passion has a different connotation. it really means the suffering of christ. this is the week that he suffers. this is the week that he gets crucified and then resurrected. so, he goes to jerusalem on sunday. this is around the time of passover. very important religious period for the jewish people. and he comes to jerusalem near passover. that sunday that he comes is now celebrated as palm sunday. this is imagery of it where he's coming and some people are greeting him to jerusalem as kind of a king. they're laying down these palms before his path. then, this is the famous where he goes to the main temple at jerusalem and he cleanses it of the moneychangers. he's like, ""hey, by doing these money transactions here, you are defiling the temple."" then, on thursday of that week, he has the famous last supper. some people believe this is the passover seder. most historians don't think it is. but he's meeting with his  disciples. and he's saying, ""one of you's going to betray me."" and it's judas iscariot who does. and he goes to the religious court and he says, ""hey, i have this guy who you guys don't like."" remember, this whole time that jesus is doing his ministry, he's sticking it... in a lot of ways, he's calling out these pharisees and these religious officials as hypocrites. he's getting all of these followers. a lot of these traditionalists are saying, ""this guy's blaspheming. he's saying he's the son of god. he's saying all of these things. he's doing these miracles on the sabbath, when you're not supposed to be doing anything."" and so, judas iscariot goes to the sanhedrin and says, ""hey, i have this guy. come and get him."" and they get jesus and this is the famous trial of jesus by the sanhedrin. and they say, ""hey, you've been saying all these things. we think you're blaspheming."" and jesus stays silent for the most part. so, they deem him guilty and they hand him over to the roman governor pontius pilate. and they say, ""hey, look, this guy's trying to create an insurrection against rome."" which the romans take very seriously. and, in the bible, they have him seeming somewhat reluctantly saying, ""oh, okay, do we really need to do this?"" but then he says, ""alright, if that's the way you all want it."" and so, the romans crucify jesus. and this is what is now viewed as good friday, the crucifixion of jesus. and then, on sunday, and this was predicted by jesus to his followers, he is resurrected. he leaves the tomb where he was. and this is a very important week. you have palm sunday. you have good friday. and then, you have the resurrection. and then, another very, very important event to christians is  days after the resurrection. so, after  days... over that  days after the resurrection, he's seen by his followers. he's seen by many people. he continues to preach. and then, you have the ascension where he goes to the kingdom of heaven. now, i'm gonna leave you with a quote by a famous christian historian. and it's a fascinating one. and it's very clear, because we just talked about the crucifixion and you see a cross at every church. ""christianity is the only major religion to have as its central event the humiliation of its god."" that's doctor bruce shelley. and whether you believe in christianity or you don't believe. whether you're an atheist. whether you believe in the miracles or you don't. it's worth pointing out that christianity has grown from this religion that started around this preacher in galilee and judea and now has over two billion adherents. and what was it about this religion and its central event being the humiliation of its god that made it so appealing to many, especially in that early roman empire, both to jews and to non-jews, to gentiles, and has made it such a significant religion?. the title of the content is early christianity","- [Instructor] We're now going to talk about the beginnings of one of the most important religions in human history. And, even today, the largest religion on Earth. And that, of course, is Christianity. And the central figure in Christianity is Jesus Christ. And the term Christ is given to him. It is Greek for savior, for messiah. Because his early followers view him as the prophesized messiah, savior, for the Jewish people. And his followers today view him as the savior, the messiah, for all humankind. So, you have over two billion Christians who view him central to their faith. Who view him as their god. But, above and beyond that, you also have over a billion Muslims who view him as a significant prophet. Now, just to get some context on the life and times of Jesus, most of the accounts we have of him come from the first four books of the New Testament of the Bible called the Gospel of Matthew, Gospel of Mark, Gospel of Luke, Gospel of John. Sometimes it's the Gospel According to Matthew, Mark, Luke, or John. And the term gospel today often refers to the idea of the life and teaching of Jesus Christ. So, you could view it as the life and teaching of Jesus Christ according to Matthew, according to Mark, according to Luke, according to John. But it really comes from old English for good news. And there is a related term, evangel. You might have heard of evangelical or evangelize. Also referring to good news. Now, the reason why it was considered good news is his message.... We're gonna have some examples of it in a few minutes. Really talks about this idea that the poor have the kingdom of heaven waiting for them.

As you can see, Jesus was born slightly before the year one. Most historians put his birth at around four to six BCE, Before the Common Era. And they put his death around 30 to 33 CE, in the Common Era. You could also use the original terms, Before Christ and Anno Dominei, In the Year of Our Lord. Our modern calendar system really uses the original view of the birth of Jesus as where we start Anno Dominei versus Before Christ or the Common Era versus Before the Common Era. Now, it's interesting that it turns out that Jesus was likely born slightly before. Slightly before the original view on the birth of Christ. Now, his birth would have been right around the time... Or it would have been under the reign of Emperor Augustus, as we talk about in other videos. And his death would have been under the reign of Emperor Tiberius. And these Gospels of Mark, Matthew, Luke, and John. These are written during really hard times for the Jewish people and for the early Christians. You have the Jewish Rebellion where the Second Temple is destroyed by Rome. You have the significant Christian persecution, especially by folks like Emperor Nero where he blames the fire in Rome on Christians and he just, essentially, just kills them for fun. Really just to purge them, to persecute them. And, just to understand where all of this takes place, the life and times of Jesus takes place, it is in the Roman Empire. We're on the eastern edge of it at the eastern Mediterranean right over here. This would be modern day Israel and Palestine for the most part. This is a zoomed in version. And Jesus is born in Bethlehem. And this is a scene. I'm gonna show you a lot of paintings. As you can imagine, he's a figure that has inspired a lot of paintings. This is a figure of the three magi visiting and giving their gifts to the infant Jesus. Magi, famously the Zoroastrian priests, coming from Persia to visit Jesus, according to biblical accounts. And he is raised in Nazareth. And that's why he's oftentimes referred to as Jesus of Nazareth. And the gospels don't talk a lot about his early life. They start to talk a lot about his life once he hits his late 20's or early 30's. And the first really significant account after his famous birth to the virgin Mary. His purported father, Joseph, was Mary's husband, but the Holy Ghost or God was the actual father, making this a virgin birth. But, after that, the first significant event is really his baptism by John the Baptist. John the Baptist was another preacher, prophetic figure of that time. A significant one. He had a lot of followers. And he as baptizing people in the Jordan River, right in that region. This is the Jordan River right over here. And this is a depiction of the famous baptism of Jesus by John the Baptist. And, famously, John the Baptist said, ""No, you should be baptizing me."" But then after Jesus said, ""No, no, you baptize me."" And, after, Jesus was baptized. Famously the sun shines on Jesus and God speaks that ""This is my son."" According to, once again, biblical accounts. And John the Baptist, shortly after that, gets arrested by King Herod of Galilee. Remember, Galilee is the home region of Jesus where he will eventually do most of his preaching. And, after that, Jesus starts to really go full into effect in his ministry. And, while he's doing that, he's performing all of these miracles. He's healing people, turning water into wine, walking on water, bringing people back from the dead. And this is, of course, according to biblical accounts. You can decide if you believe these or not. And he does most of that in Galilee. And, eventually, he makes his way down to Jerusalem to meet his fate. He tells, according to the Gospels, his followers, his disciples.... And there's 12 in particular that are called out, but he has many, many more than that. That ""Look, I am going to meet my fate there, but I'm doing it willingly."" But, more than his miracles, it's interesting to look at some of what he preached. And this might give you a little bit of a sense why many people would have called this good news. So, this is from the Gospel of Matthew that I'm gonna quote right over here. And this first part comes from his Sermon of the Mount. He goes to the top of a mountain and he gives this sermon. ""Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven."" ""Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth."" ""Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy."" ""Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God."" ""Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called sons of God."" So, all of that, if you're a peasant, if you're someone with not a lot, you're downtrodden, hard life. You're like, ""Look, blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven."" you could view this as good news. ""Ye have heard that it was said an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth, but I say unto you, resist not him that is evil. But whosoever smiteth thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also."" Even in modern times, this is not an easy way... This is not an easy way to live. Someone who's doing something to you, don't try to seek revenge. And this is a very different tone than a lot of what you might get in the Old Testament. ""Ye have heard that it was said, thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy, but I say unto you love your enemies and pray for them that persecute you."" Once again, not an easy thing to do. Even in modern terms, you can view this as a very forward, very advanced way of thinking about the world. He also, beyond this idea of embracing even your enemies and not seeking revenge and that the poor have access to this kingdom of heaven, he really also liked to take it to the hypocrites, especially those who viewed themselves as the bearers of the religion. In particular, he picks on the Pharisees, which was a sect of Jews at the time who viewed themselves very ritualistic. Remember, Jesus, himself, is a Jewish preacher. He's a Jewish teacher. He is viewed as a rabbi himself. ""And when ye pray, ye shall not be as the hypocrites. For they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and in the corners of the street that they may be seen of men."" So, these hypocrites, they pray just so other people can see how religious they are. ""Verily, I say unto you, they have received their reward."" They've already gotten the credit from people for praying. ""But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thine inner chamber and, having shut thy door, pray to thy Father who is in secret, and thy Father, who seeth in secret shall recompense thee."" So, don't make a big deal about your prayer. Do it in private and then have this personal connection with God. Now, it's worth noting that, even though he preached a lot about the kingdom of heaven for the poor, prayer is a private thing, that you shouldn't try to seek revenge, you should be very conciliatory to your enemies, he did take a strong stance on what he was preaching. He did say, ""Look, you gotta be with me if you want to enter into this kingdom of heaven."" He took some strong stances. This isn't gonna be an easy thing and this is gonna cause a lot of tension. This is one quote that you could view that way. Once again, from the Gospel of Matthew, ""Think not that I came to send peace on earth. I came not to send peace, but a sword. For I came to set a man at variance against his father and the daughter against her mother."" I would interpret this as saying this is gonna cause a lot of divisiveness. ""And the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law. And a man's foes shall be they of his own household. He that loveth father and mother more than me is not worthy of me. And he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me. And he that doth not take his cross and follow after me is not worthy of me. He that findeth his life shall lose it and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it."" So, he takes a pretty strong stance. ""Look, you really need to follow me. But, if you follow me, there's some very good things that are waiting for you."" But, eventually, he does make his way... He tells his... There's other.... These miracles he's performing. This is the famous Transfiguration of Christ where he makes it apparent to his followers. He kind of becomes luminescent and he becomes apparent to his followers, his disciples, that he truly is the son of God. And then, he makes his way... This is the year, depending on whether you think it's 30, 31, 32, 33 CE. He makes his way to Jerusalem to meet his fate. He's already prophesized to his followers that this is gonna be a tough fate. That he's gonna die there. And this is a very important week in Christianity. It's referred to as Passion Week. And the term passion has a different connotation. It really means the suffering of Christ. This is the week that he suffers. This is the week that he gets crucified and then resurrected. So, he goes to Jerusalem on Sunday. This is around the time of Passover. Very important religious period for the Jewish people. And he comes to Jerusalem near Passover. That Sunday that he comes is now celebrated as Palm Sunday. This is imagery of it where he's coming and some people are greeting him to Jerusalem as kind of a king. They're laying down these palms before his path. Then, this is the famous where he goes to the main temple at Jerusalem and he cleanses it of the moneychangers. He's like, ""Hey, by doing these money transactions here, you are defiling the temple."" Then, on Thursday of that week, he has the famous Last Supper. Some people believe this is the Passover seder. Most historians don't think it is. But he's meeting with his 12 disciples. And he's saying, ""One of you's going to betray me."" And it's Judas Iscariot who does. And he goes to the religious court and he says, ""Hey, I have this guy who you guys don't like."" Remember, this whole time that Jesus is doing his ministry, he's sticking it... In a lot of ways, he's calling out these Pharisees and these religious officials as hypocrites. He's getting all of these followers. A lot of these traditionalists are saying, ""This guy's blaspheming. He's saying he's the son of God. He's saying all of these things. He's doing these miracles on the Sabbath, when you're not supposed to be doing anything."" And so, Judas Iscariot goes to the Sanhedrin and says, ""Hey, I have this guy. Come and get him."" And they get Jesus and this is the famous trial of Jesus by the Sanhedrin. And they say, ""Hey, you've been saying all these things. We think you're blaspheming."" And Jesus stays silent for the most part. So, they deem him guilty and they hand him over to the Roman governor Pontius Pilate. And they say, ""Hey, look, this guy's trying to create an insurrection against Rome."" Which the Romans take very seriously. And, in the Bible, they have him seeming somewhat reluctantly saying, ""Oh, okay, do we really need to do this?"" But then he says, ""Alright, if that's the way you all want it."" And so, the Romans crucify Jesus. And this is what is now viewed as Good Friday, The crucifixion of Jesus. And then, on Sunday, and this was predicted by Jesus to his followers, he is resurrected. He leaves the tomb where he was. And this is a very important week. You have Palm Sunday. You have Good Friday. And then, you have the resurrection. And then, another very, very important event to Christians is 40 days after the resurrection. So, after 40 days... Over that 40 days after the resurrection, he's seen by his followers. He's seen by many people. He continues to preach. And then, you have the ascension where he goes to the kingdom of heaven. Now, I'm gonna leave you with a quote by a famous Christian historian. And it's a fascinating one. And it's very clear, because we just talked about the crucifixion and you see a cross at every church. ""Christianity is the only major religion to have as its central event the humiliation of its God."" That's Doctor Bruce Shelley. And whether you believe in Christianity or you don't believe. Whether you're an atheist. Whether you believe in the miracles or you don't. It's worth pointing out that Christianity has grown from this religion that started around this preacher in Galilee and Judea and now has over two billion adherents. And what was it about this religion and its central event being the humiliation of its God that made it so appealing to many, especially in that early Roman Empire, both to Jews and to non-Jews, to Gentiles, and has made it such a significant religion?",Early Christianity,Khan Academy (English - CBSE India Curriculum) >> Arts and humanities >> World history >> 600 BCE - 600 CE Second-Wave Civilizations >> Early Christianity,"christianity starts as a jewish sect on the periphery of the roman empire. despite being actively persecuted, the religion grows through the empire, eventually becoming the official state religion.. this is the topic tree khan academy (english - cbse india curriculum) >> arts and humanities >> world history >>  bce -  ce second-wave civilizations >> early christianity",video

[theme music] any understanding of christianity has to start with judaism, because jesus was born a jew, and he grew up in the jewish tradition. he was one of many teachers spreading his ideas in the roman province of judea at the time, and he was part of a messianic tradition that helps us understand why he was thought of not only teacher but something much, much more. let’s go straight to the thought bubble today. the people who would become the jews, were just one of many tribal peoples eking out an existence in that not-very fertile crescent world of mesopotamia after the agricultural revolution. the hebrews initially worshiped many gods, making sacrifices to them in order to bring good weather and good fortune. but they eventually developed a religion centered around an idea that would become key to the other great western religions. this was monotheism, the idea that there is only one true god (or at least that if there are other gods around, they are total lameoids). the hebrews developed a second concept that is key to their religion as well: the idea of the covenant, a deal with god. the main man in this, the big macher was abraham. not to make this too much of a scripture lesson, but it’s kind of hard to understand the jews without understanding abraham, or abram as he was known before he had his big conversation with god. recorded in genesis : ""when abram was ninety years and nine, the lord appeared to abram, and said unto him, 'i am the almighty god; walk before me, and be thou perfect.' "" and i’m a make a covenant with you and a bunch of cool things will happen like you’re gonna have kids and your descendants will number the stars and you can have all the land of canaan forever, it’s gonna be awesome. i’m paraphrasing by the way, thought bubble. so god promised that abram would have kids with his wife even though the dude was already like , but there was a catch: ""this is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; every man child among you shall be circumcised."" keep it pg-, thought bubble. now that is asking a lot from a guy, especially a -year-old geezer like abram living in a time before general anesthesia. but those were the terms of the deal, and in exchange god had chosen abraham and his descendants to be a great nation. from this we get the expression that the jews are the chosen people. thanks for keeping it clean, thought bubble. so, some important things about this god: one, singularity. he — and i’m using the masculine pronoun because that’s what hebrew prayers use — does not want you to put any gods before him. he is also transcendent, having always existed and he is deeply personal – he chats with prophets, sends locusts, etc. but he doesn’t take corporeal form like the greek and roman gods do. he is also involved in history, like he will destroy cities, and bring floods, and determine the outcome of wars, and possibly football games. stan, no! football games! probably most important to us today, and certainly most important to jesus, this god demands moral righteousness and social justice. so, this is the god of the hebrews, yahweh, and despite many ups and downs, the jewish people have stuck with him for- according to the hebrew calendar, at least- over  years. and he has stuck by them too, despite the jews being, on occasion, something of a disappointment to him. which leads to various miseries, and also to a tradition of prophets who speak for god and warn the people to get back on the right path lest there be more miseries. which brings us back to our friends, the romans. by the time that jesus was born, the land of the israelites had been absorbed into the roman empire as the province of judea. at the time of jesus’s birth, judea was under the control of herod the great, best known for building the massive temple in jerusalem, that the romans would later destroy. and by the time jesus died, an expanded judea was under the rule of herod antipater. also, unhelpfully, known as herod. both herods ultimately took their orders from the romans, and they both show up on the list of rulers who are oppressive to the jews, partly because there’s never that much religious freedom in an empire. unless you are, wait for it... the mongols [mongoltage] or the persians. also, they were hellenizers, bringing in greek theater and architecture, and rationalism. and in response to those hellenistic influences, there were a lot of preachers trying to get the jews to return to the traditions and the godly ways of the past, including the sadducees, and the pharisees, and the essenes, and the zealots. and one of those preachers, who didn’t fit comfortably into any of these four groups, was jesus of nazareth. jesus was a preacher who spread his message of peace, love and, above all, justice, across judea over the course of his actually average-length life for his time. he was remarkably charismatic, attracting a small but incredibly loyal group of followers, and he was said to perform miracles — although it’s worth noting that miracles weren’t terribly uncommon at the time. jesus’s message was particularly resonant to the poor and downtrodden and pretty radical in its anti-authoritarian stance. he said it was easier for a camel to get through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to get to heaven, he said the meek were blessed, that the last would be first and the first would be last — all of which was kind of threatening to the powers that be, who accordingly had him arrested, tried and then executed in the normal method of killing rebels at that time: crucifixion. also, just to put this question to bed, the romans crucified jesus, because he was a threat to their authority. later traditions saying that the jews killed jesus? very unfortunate, also, very untrue. we’re not going to discuss jesus’s divinity, because: . this isn’t a theology class, and . flame wars on the internet make me so uncomfortable that i have to turn to camera . hi there camera , i’m here to remind you that . fighting over such things, like fighting over whether the proverbial cake is a lie, rarely accomplishes anything, plus . what matters to us is the historical fact that people at the time believed that jesus was the messiah, the anointed one, the son of god. and they believed that he would return some day to redeem the world. which leads us to two questions about christianity: first, why did this small group of people believe this? and second, why and how did that belief become so widespread? so why would people believe that jesus was the messiah? first. the jews had a long tradition of believing that a savior who would come to them in a time of trouble. and judea under the rule of herod and the romans... definitely a time of trouble. and many of the prophecies about this savior point to someone whose life looks a lot like jesus's. for instance, isaiah  says the person will be misunderstood and mistreated, just like jesus was: “he was despised, and rejected by men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and as one from whom men hide their face he was despised; and we didn't respect him.” and a lot of the prophecies like daniel :, for instance, explained that when the messiah comes there will be this awesome, new, everlasting kingdom. and that had to sound pretty good to people who’d had their autonomy taken away from them. so some religious jews saw jesus in those prophecies and came to believe either during his life or shortly thereafter, that he was the messiah. most of them thought the new everlasting kingdom was right around the corner, which is probably why no one bothered to write down much about the life of jesus for several decades, by which time it was clear that we might have to wait a bit for this brilliant new everlasting kingdom. i should note, by the way, that the idea of a messiah was not unique to the jews at the time. even the romans got in on the action, for instance, the roman poet virgil wrote of a boy who: “shall free the earth from never-ceasing fear, he shall receive the life of gods, and see heroes with gods commingling.” sound familiar? but virgil was writing about emperor augustus in that poem, not jesus, which points again to the similarities between the two. both called sons of god. both sent to free the earth from never-ceasing fear. but one ruled the largest empire in the world; and the other believed that empire, and the world, needed to change dramatically. so why did the less wealthy and famous son of god become by far the more influential? well, here are three possible historical reasons: reason #: the romans continued to make things bad for the jews. in fact, things got much worse for the jews, especially after they launched a revolt between - ce, which did not go well. by the time the dust settled, the romans had destroyed the temple and expelled the jews from judea, beginning what we now know as the jewish diaspora. and without a temple or geographic unity, the jews had to solidify what it meant to be a jew and what the basic tenants of the religion were. this forced the followers of jesus to make a decision: were they going to continue to be jews following stricter laws set forth by rabbis, or were they going to be something else. the decision to open up their religion to non-jews, people who weren’t part of the covenant, is the central reason that christianity could become a world religion instead of just a sect of judaism. and it probably didn’t hurt that the main proponent of sticking with judaism was james, jesus’s brother, who was killed by the romans. reason #: is related to reason # and it’s all about a dude named saul. no, not that saul. yes, saul of tarsus, thank you. saul, having received a vision on the road to damascus, became paul and began visiting and sending letters to jesus followers throughout the mediterranean. and it was paul who emphatically declared that jesus followers did not have to be jews, that they did not have to be circumcised or keep to jewish laws or any of that stuff. this opened the floodgates for thousands of people to convert to this new religion. and the other thing to remember about paul is that he was a roman citizen, which meant that he could travel freely throughout the roman empire. this allowed him to make his case to lots of different people and facilitated the geographic spread of christianity. oh, it’s time for the open letter? alright. an open letter, to the fish. but first, lets see what’s in the secret compartment today. oh, stan. it’s my favorite album jesus christ superstar, finally available in my favorite format, the cassette. did i color-coordinate my shirt to jesus christ superstar? yes. dear ichthys, so check this out: in the first century when it was still super underground and hipster to be a christian, you were a secret symbol of christianity, used to kind of hide from the romans. ichthys, the greek word for fish, was an acronym and it was a super clever way to talk about religion without anyone knowing that you were talking about it. but you’ll never guess what happened - even in places where it’s completely fine to talk about christianity now and to use, you know, regular christian symbols, like the cross, you have had a huge resurgence thanks to the plastic automobile decal industry. i mean seriously, ichthys, i haven’t seen a comeback like this since jesus. best wishes, john green and lastly, christianity was born and flourished an empire with a common language that allowed for its spread. and crucially, it was also an empire in decline. like even by the end of the first century ce, rome was on its way down. and for the average person, and even for some elites, things weren’t as good as they had been, if fact they were getting worse so fast that you might have thought the end of the world was coming. and roman religion offered no promise of an afterlife, and a bunch of squabbling whiny gods - sorry if i offended adherents to roman religion, but seriously, they squabble. so even though early christians were persecuted by the roman empire and sometimes fed to the lions and other animals, the religion continued to grow, albeit slowly. but then as the roman decline continued, emperor constantine allowed the worship of jesus and then eventually converted to christianity himself. and then the religion really took off. i mean, rome wasn’t what it used to be, but everybody still wanted to be like the emperor. and soon enough there was a new son of god on coins. thanks for watching. see you next week. crash course is produced and directed by stan muller, our script supervisor is danica johnson. the show is written by my high school history teacher raoul meyer and myself and our graphics team is thought bubble. as only  million of you guessed last week, the phrase of the week was ""chipotle burrito""; if you want to guess at this week’s phrase of the week or suggest future ones, you can do so in comments where you can also ask questions about today’s video that will be answered, hopefully, by our team of historians. thanks for watching crash course, and as we say in my hometown, don't forget to be awesome. ow... again.. the title of the content is christianity from judaism to constantine - crash course world history","Hi there my name’s John Green; this is Crash Course World History and today we’re going to talk about Jesus. So this is a Roman coin from around the time Jesus was born in the Roman Empire, and it calls Augustus, the emperor, the son of God. So let’s just state at the outset that in 4 BCE, being the son of God, or at least being the son of a god was not such an unusual thing. But a poor Jew being the son of God — that was news. [Theme Music] Any understanding of Christianity has to start with Judaism, because Jesus was born a Jew, and he grew up in the Jewish tradition. He was one of many teachers spreading his ideas in the Roman province of Judea at the time, and he was part of a messianic tradition that helps us understand why he was thought of not only teacher but something much, much more. Let’s go straight to the Thought Bubble today. The people who would become the Jews, were just one of many tribal peoples eking out an existence in that not-very fertile crescent world of Mesopotamia after the agricultural revolution. The Hebrews initially worshiped many gods, making sacrifices to them in order to bring good weather and good fortune. But they eventually developed a religion centered around an idea that would become key to the other great western religions. This was monotheism, the idea that there is only one true god (or at least that if there are other gods around, they are total lameoids). The Hebrews developed a second concept that is key to their religion as well: the idea of the covenant, a deal with God. The main man in this, the big macher was Abraham. Not to make this too much of a scripture lesson, but it’s kind of hard to understand the Jews without understanding Abraham, or Abram as he was known before he had his big conversation with God. Recorded in Genesis 17: ""When Abram was ninety years and nine, the LORD appeared to Abram, and said unto him, 'I am the Almighty God; walk before me, and be thou perfect.' "" And I’m a make a covenant with you and a bunch of cool things will happen like you’re gonna have kids and your descendants will number the stars and you can have all the land of Canaan forever, it’s gonna be awesome. I’m paraphrasing by the way, Thought Bubble. So God promised that Abram would have kids with his wife even though the dude was already like 99, but there was a catch: ""This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; every man child among you shall be circumcised."" Keep it PG-13, Thought Bubble. Now that is asking a lot from a guy, especially a 99-year-old geezer like Abram living in a time before general anesthesia. But those were the terms of the deal, and in exchange God had chosen Abraham and his descendants to be a great nation. From this we get the expression that the Jews are the Chosen people. Thanks for keeping it clean, Thought Bubble. So, some important things about this god: One, singularity. He — and I’m using the masculine pronoun because that’s what Hebrew prayers use — does not want you to put any gods before Him. He is also transcendent, having always existed and he is deeply personal – he chats with prophets, sends locusts, etc. But he doesn’t take corporeal form like the Greek and Roman Gods do. He is also involved in history, like he will destroy cities, and bring floods, and determine the outcome of wars, and possibly football games. Stan, no! FOOTBALL games! Probably most important to us today, and certainly most important to Jesus, this god demands moral righteousness and social justice. So, this is the god of the Hebrews, Yahweh, and despite many ups and downs, the Jewish people have stuck with him for- according to the Hebrew calendar, at least- over 5700 years. And He has stuck by them too, despite the Jews being, on occasion, something of a disappointment to him. Which leads to various miseries, and also to a tradition of prophets who speak for God and warn the people to get back on the right path lest there be more miseries. Which brings us back to our friends, the Romans. By the time that Jesus was born, the land of the Israelites had been absorbed into the Roman Empire as the province of Judea. At the time of Jesus’s birth, Judea was under the control of Herod the Great, best known for building the massive temple in Jerusalem, that the Romans would later destroy. And by the time Jesus died, an expanded Judea was under the rule of Herod Antipater. Also, unhelpfully, known as Herod. Both Herods ultimately took their orders from the Romans, and they both show up on the list of rulers who are oppressive to the Jews, partly because there’s never that much religious freedom in an empire. Unless you are, wait for it... The Mongols [Mongoltage] or the Persians. Also, they were Hellenizers, bringing in Greek theater and architecture, and rationalism. And in response to those Hellenistic influences, there were a lot of preachers trying to get the Jews to return to the traditions and the godly ways of the past, including the Sadducees, and the Pharisees, and the Essenes, and the Zealots. And one of those preachers, who didn’t fit comfortably into any of these four groups, was Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus was a preacher who spread his message of peace, love and, above all, justice, across Judea over the course of his actually average-length life for his time. He was remarkably charismatic, attracting a small but incredibly loyal group of followers, and he was said to perform miracles — although it’s worth noting that miracles weren’t terribly uncommon at the time. Jesus’s message was particularly resonant to the poor and downtrodden and pretty radical in its anti-authoritarian stance. He said it was easier for a camel to get through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to get to heaven, he said the meek were blessed, that the last would be first and the first would be last — all of which was kind of threatening to the powers that be, who accordingly had him arrested, tried and then executed in the normal method of killing rebels at that time: crucifixion. Also, just to put this question to bed, the Romans crucified Jesus, because he was a threat to their authority. Later traditions saying that the Jews killed Jesus? Very unfortunate, also, very untrue. We’re not going to discuss Jesus’s divinity, because: 1. This isn’t a theology class, and 2. Flame wars on the Internet make me so uncomfortable that I have to turn to camera 2. Hi there camera 2, I’m here to remind you that 3. Fighting over such things, like fighting over whether the proverbial cake is a lie, rarely accomplishes anything, plus 4. What matters to us is the historical fact that people at the time believed that Jesus was the Messiah, the Anointed One, the son of God. And they believed that he would return some day to redeem the world. Which leads us to two questions about Christianity: First, Why did this small group of people believe this? And second, why and how did that belief become so widespread? So why would people believe that Jesus was the Messiah? First. The Jews had a long tradition of believing that a savior who would come to them in a time of trouble. And Judea under the rule of Herod and the Romans... definitely a time of trouble. And many of the prophecies about this savior point to someone whose life looks a lot like Jesus's. For instance, Isaiah 53 says the person will be misunderstood and mistreated, just like Jesus was: “He was despised, and rejected by men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and as one from whom men hide their face he was despised; and we didn't respect him.” And a lot of the prophecies like Daniel 7:14, for instance, explained that when the Messiah comes there will be this awesome, new, everlasting kingdom. And that had to sound pretty good to people who’d had their autonomy taken away from them. So some religious Jews saw Jesus in those prophecies and came to believe either during his life or shortly thereafter, that he was the messiah. Most of them thought the new everlasting kingdom was right around the corner, which is probably why no one bothered to write down much about the life of Jesus for several decades, by which time it was clear that we might have to wait a bit for this brilliant new everlasting kingdom. I should note, by the way, that the idea of a messiah was not unique to the Jews at the time. Even the Romans got in on the action, for instance, the Roman poet Virgil wrote of a boy who: “Shall free the earth from never-ceasing fear, he shall receive the life of gods, and see Heroes with gods commingling.” Sound familiar? But Virgil was writing about Emperor Augustus in that poem, not Jesus, which points again to the similarities between the two. Both called sons of God. Both sent to free the earth from never-ceasing fear. But one ruled the largest empire in the world; and the other believed that empire, and the world, needed to change dramatically. So why did the less wealthy and famous son of God become by far the more influential? Well, here are three possible historical reasons: Reason #1: The Romans continued to make things bad for the Jews. In fact, things got much worse for the Jews, especially after they launched a revolt between 66-73 CE, which did not go well. By the time the dust settled, the Romans had destroyed the Temple and expelled the Jews from Judea, beginning what we now know as the Jewish Diaspora. And without a Temple or geographic unity, the Jews had to solidify what it meant to be a Jew and what the basic tenants of the religion were. This forced the followers of Jesus to make a decision: were they going to continue to be Jews following stricter laws set forth by rabbis, or were they going to be something else. The decision to open up their religion to non-Jews, people who weren’t part of the covenant, is the central reason that Christianity could become a world religion instead of just a sect of Judaism. And it probably didn’t hurt that the main proponent of sticking with Judaism was James, Jesus’s brother, who was killed by the Romans. Reason #2: Is related to Reason #1 and it’s all about a dude named Saul. No, not that Saul. Yes, Saul of Tarsus, thank you. Saul, having received a vision on the road to Damascus, became Paul and began visiting and sending letters to Jesus followers throughout the Mediterranean. And it was Paul who emphatically declared that Jesus followers did NOT have to be Jews, that they did not have to be circumcised or keep to Jewish laws or any of that stuff. This opened the floodgates for thousands of people to convert to this new religion. And the other thing to remember about Paul is that he was a Roman citizen, which meant that he could travel freely throughout the Roman Empire. This allowed him to make his case to lots of different people and facilitated the geographic spread of Christianity. Oh, it’s time for the open letter? Alright. An open letter, to the fish. But first, lets see what’s in the secret compartment today. Oh, Stan. It’s my favorite album Jesus Christ Superstar, finally available in my favorite format, the cassette. Did I color-coordinate my shirt to Jesus Christ Superstar? Yes. Dear Ichthys, So check this out: In the first century when it was still super underground and hipster to be a Christian, you were a secret symbol of Christianity, used to kind of hide from the Romans. Ichthys, the Greek word for fish, was an acronym and it was a super clever way to talk about religion without anyone knowing that you were talking about it. But you’ll never guess what happened - even in places where it’s completely fine to talk about Christianity now and to use, you know, regular Christian symbols, like the cross, you have had a huge resurgence thanks to the plastic automobile decal industry. I mean seriously, Ichthys, I haven’t seen a comeback like this since Jesus. Best wishes, John Green And lastly, Christianity was born and flourished an empire with a common language that allowed for its spread. And crucially, it was also an Empire in decline. Like even by the end of the first century CE, Rome was on its way down. And for the average person, and even for some elites, things weren’t as good as they had been, if fact they were getting worse so fast that you might have thought the end of the world was coming. And Roman religion offered no promise of an afterlife, and a bunch of squabbling whiny gods - sorry if I offended adherents to Roman religion, but seriously, they squabble. So even though early Christians were persecuted by the Roman Empire and sometimes fed to the lions and other animals, the religion continued to grow, albeit slowly. But then as the Roman decline continued, Emperor Constantine allowed the worship of Jesus and then eventually converted to Christianity himself. And then the religion really took off. I mean, Rome wasn’t what it used to be, but everybody still wanted to be like the Emperor. And soon enough there was a new son of God on coins. Thanks for watching. See you next week.

in the world. it is also one of the most diverse in terms of practice. this video gives an overview of the central spiritual ideas of brahman, atman, samsara and moksha.  . - [instructor] we're now going to talk about hinduism which is one of the largest religions on earth, practiced by over a billion people. and, it's interesting for several reasons. first, it is considered to be one of the oldest religions that is still practiced. some historians would place the origins of hinduism at , years into the past. it has elements that may have been practiced in the indus valley civilization. you also have significant elements that come from the vedic period. in fact, the vedas, for which the vedic period is named really form the root of hinduism as it is practiced today. it is believed that the vedas come from an indo-aryan people that many historians believe came from central asia and were related to many of the people who colonized europe. now, the other thing that is fascinating about hinduism, and i really just referred to some of it, it is a combination of many cultures that really merged over thousands of years. and, they merged around the indian subcontinent. as you will see there are many traditions, many cultures, many different ways that one can, and many different ways that people do practice hinduism. but, there are also core beliefs that we wanna get to the heart of in this video. and, we'll discuss more in future videos. now, what's also interesting is where the name hinduism or hindu comes from, a hindu being someone who practices hinduism. the name for what we now call the indus river in sanskrit was sindhu, and sindh is still a region in the indian subcontinent. the version that the persians said was hindus and this got converted to indus in latin. so really, hinduism is the term for the cultural and religious practices of people beyond the indus river. the india really comes from this same root. indus is where india comes from, but indus comes from hindus, which comes from sindhu and these are all related to the word hindu. and, you can see that very clearly in the persian version. now, as i mentioned, there's many different practices in hinduism, many different traditions, many different rituals in hinduism, but i'm going to try to focus in on what could be considered the spiritual core. and, a lot of this comes out of the vedas. they're a collection of hymns, rituals, but also philosophy. and, the subset of the vedas that are very concerned with the spiritual and the philosophical are known as the upanishads, which means sitting down or coming near to. some people say coming near to god, some people say coming near to the actual reality, or coming near to a teacher as in sitting down to get a lesson or to have a dialog. now, the central idea in hinduism is the idea of brahman. and brahman should not be confused with the god brahma. brahma is sometimes, you could view, as a aspect of a brahman, but brahman is viewed as the true reality of things. it is shapeless, genderless, bodiless, it cannot be described. it can only be experienced. now, according to hindu belief we are all part of brahman. and, what we perceive as our individuality is really, you can consider to be a quasi-illusion. so, this might be one individual right over here and then we might have another individual right over here. and, this separateness, the illusion of the reality that we see around us this is referred to as maya. and, maya is not just the illusion or the quasi-illusion created by our senses it is even notions like our ego, our identity. and, within that context that inner self, the thing that is even within our, that is even deeper than our sense of identity. this is referred to as atman. and, as you can see they way it's been diagrammed here, the way we've drawn it out atman is essentially the same thing as brahman. and, oftentimes you will see it referred to as atman-brahman, they're really the same thing but it's really, it's an illusion that there is this separateness of our reality. now, according to hindu belief in each life you have this core part of yourself which is atman, which is part of brahman. and, when you die it doesn't disappear, but it will take on or it will subjugate itself to another reality. so, after death this individual or this perceived individual might take on another identity in another reality. they would perceive it as another life. and, this notion of one life after another, one reality after another is sometimes referred to as transmigration of the soul, sometimes referred to reincarnation, or this notion of samsara, which is this endless cycle of birth and rebirth. it really comes from this notion of same flowing, this thing, this pattern that goes on and on and on. and, according to hindu belief what that next life is, what that next reality is is based on your actions in this life. karma, literally is referring to actions, but it's really actions driving consequences not only in this reality but in the next reality. now, there's another notion of dharma. dharma is based on what is the role you should play given the reality, given the life that you are in. so, in a very simplified way you could say, ""well, dharma is the rightful role, the rightful actions, ""your duty depending on your role, ""depending on your reality."" karma is how that action translates into consequences which is going to drive what happens in this endless cycle. now, a core idea of hinduism is to try to escape from this cycle, to awaken to the true reality, awaken from this quasi-reality. and, this is really one of the central ideas of the upanishads that eventually if you can awaken, so let's say that this is an awakening, this entity, this atman, this self right over here, this perceived individual has now awoken and can see through, pierces the veil of that maya. now, they have rejoined brahman and they've recognized that atman and brahman are the same. and, this freeing from samsara, from this birth death cycle, this is referred to as moksha. now, to make this idea a little bit clearer let's look at some quotes from the actual upanishads. so, this is two versions from the isha upanishad and the reason why i like to show it is because it shows that if you're translating from sanskrit into english or really from any one language into another there's gonna be some room for interpretation but we can see it here. so, this is from the isha upanishad which is considered one of most important ones. it's a subset, it's a section of the yajurveda, one of the four early vedas. and, they write, and this is an english translation, ""the wise man beholds all beings in the self, or the atman, ""and the self in all beings, for that reason ""he does not hate anyone. ""to the seer all things have verily become the self. ""what delusion, what sorrow can there be for him ""who beholds that oneness?"" this is another version of the same verses from the isha upanishad. ""he who sees all beings in the self and the self ""in all beings he never turns away from it, the self. ""for, he who percieves all beings as the self ""how can there be delusion or grief ""when he sees this oneness everywhere."" so, i might be getting into an argument with someone but deep down if i recognize that both myself and that individual that we are part of this same brahman that he is me and i am it, or i am he, well then that anger seems a little bit misguided. now, to get a little bit more context on this notion of oneness here's another verse from chandogya upanishad, which is also considered one of the significant upanishads. and, it's part of the sama veda. ""as the rivers flowing east and west merge in the sea ""and become one with it, forgetting they were separate ""rivers, so do all creatures lose their separateness ""when they merge at last into pure being,"" into brahman. ""there's nothing that does not come from him."" and, the use of the word him is really an anthropomorphism of this notion that has really no gender or body or form. ""of everything he is the inmost self. ""he is the truth, he is the self supreme. ""you are that shvetaketu, you are that."" and, this last verse is referring it's in this chandogya upanishad it's a conversation between the teacher and his son. and, the son is shvetaketu, my apologies for pronunciation. so, what's he's saying is that these rivers is an analogy for you and i and we might see ourselves as different but at some point we will flow and become one with the ocean. and, he's pointing out to his son, you are not different from that, you are self, you are ahtman. it is brahman, it is one and the same.. the title of the content is hinduism: core ideas of brahman, atman, samsara and moksha.","- [Instructor] We're now going to talk about Hinduism which is one of the largest religions on Earth, practiced by over a billion people.

this really angers them, and so we read from the book of acts, they all rushed at him, dragged him out of the city, and began to stone him. meanwhile, the witnesses lay their coats at the feet of a young man named saul, and we see him right over here, depicted in this painting. saul approved of their killing him. on that day, a great persecution broke out against the church in jerusalem. all except the apostles were scattered throughout judea and samaria. godly men buried stephen and mourned deeply for him. but saul began to destroy the church. going from house to house, he dragged off both men and women and put them in prison. he is a pretty fervent persecutor of christians. it goes even further. then, we read, we go on to read in the book of acts, meanwhile, saul was still breathing out murderous threats against the lord's disciples. he went to the high priest and asked him for letters to the synagogues in damascus, so that if he found any there who belonged to the way, whether men or women, he might take them as prisoners to jerusalem. as he neared damascus on his journey, so this is going to be interesting thing. he's so fervent, he goes to the high priest, and says, i wanna persecute these christians wherever they are. i wanna go to damascus, and see if i can persecute them there. as he neared damascus on his journey, suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him. he fell to the ground and heard a voice say to him, ""saul, saul, why do you persecute me?"" this is an image of that, this narrative in the bible. ""who are you, lord?"", saul asked. ""i am jesus, whom you are persecuting,"" he replied. ""now get up and go into the city,"" the city being damascus, ""and you will be told what you must do."" paul is blinded by this event. he's blind for three days. he goes to damascus, and he is healed by a follower of christ. at that moment, he completely does a . he goes from being one of the chief persecutors of the christians, to being one of the chief believers, and he starts to aggressively spread the faith. so that brings us, so let's go to this map, because what's significant about paul is peter was, you can really view him as the first head of the church, especially after jesus, but he primarily viewed it as something to spread amongst the jewish people. there are events, for example, in acts where he does realize, hey, maybe i should be, the word of jesus should go beyond the jewish people. it should go to the non-jews, who are referred to as gentiles. but paul, and you can see on the map here, he has this revelation, i guess you could say, as he's approaching damascus. he goes back to jerusalem, and he tries to convince the other followers, and you can imagine they're quite skeptical of this person who is shortly before persecuting them. but he eventually convinces them, and he goes on multiple missionary journeys, spreading the faith. his center of operations is at antioch, and he's a significant figure who helps build the church at antioch. what's interesting about the church of antioch, it ends up being a very significant church, is that at antioch, the christians, or the christian faith, is not just spread to the jewish people, they're spread to the non-jews, to the gentiles. it's actually at the church of antioch that the followers of jesus christ, according to biblical accounts, were first referred to as christians. what you see on this map, here, are the various missionary journeys that paul, who is a roman citizen, was able, or saul, depending on which name you want to use, was able to do through, especially the eastern roman empire. in that mid  here, let me, in the mid , right over here, he does a missionary journey. once again, antioch is his base, he goes to cyprus, and southern, mid, what we would call turkey today. in the early , he goes on this fairly long journey through modern day turkey, through macedonia, through greece. as he's doing this, he's spreading the word of jesus christ. he's starting to help establish churches in these significant places, philippi, thessalonica, corinth, all of these various places. you see his third journey, here, very similar in path in yellow to the second journey. he does that in the late  ce. once again, he's constantly establishing these churches. the important thing to realize about paul, it's a controversy. to what degree should the teachings of jesus be spread to the gentiles, to the non-jewish people? there are these famous debates, and paul's view is, no, we should not force the gentiles to do everything that the jews have to do, the circumcision, the jewish dietary laws. you could imagine, this doubly angers the church leaders. not only is he spreading the word of jesus, that has annoyed them to no end, but he also wants to spread it to the gentiles, but he doesn't think that the gentiles need to perform all of the things that the jewish leaders believe are dictated by the laws of moses, by the jewish faith. and circumcision is actually a major debate. circumcision, the dietary habits, et cetera, et cetera. eventually, he goes back to jerusalem to face this leadership, and now this is in the early , and they, once again, they put him on trial. as a jewish citizen, he says, hey, i have a right to see the emperor. he is taken to rome, and along the way they get caught in a storm, but eventually he makes his way to rome, where he is held prisoner. it is believed that both peter and paul were killed by nero. we talk in previous videos, the fire in  ce in rome that destroys a large chunk of the city. some people think nero actually set the fire to clear some land so that he could build his palace. he famously blames the fire on christians. there's a large purge of christians that occur after that. a lot of accounts say that peter was crucified by nero. he requests, according to these accounts, to be crucified upside down, because he doesn't deserve to get the same crucifixion as jesus, and paul, some accounts say, that he was beheaded. once again, they're dying in these christian purges that nero is performing. you can see it right over here, if those accounts are true. now it's really interesting, i already talked about paul being this missionary to the gentiles. he is the one, especially at the church of antioch, where christianity starts to really separate from judaism, starts to become a faith in it's own right. that was even further accelerated in a few years after their death, or it might have been roughly coincident with their death, depending on when their deaths were. from  to , you have the jewish rebellion, sometimes called the first roman-jewish war, and it ends with the roman empire destroying the temple at jerusalem, the center of the jewish faith. the second temple of jerusalem, the one that was rebuilt, partially, by cyrus the great. so this causes the jewish people to have to leave, and they no longer have this center of their people. you have the jewish diaspora that gets spread throughout the roman empire, and other empires, like the parthians in persia. they really, there's a famous battle in  of masada, this mountain fortress, where the romans, essentially, well, it's a mass suicide, but it's this bloody extermination of the jewish people in and around jerusalem, so they are spread. that's, obviously, a significant series of events for the jewish people, but it's also significant for christianity, because jerusalem was a center of the christian faith. now the christian followers are going to be spread around, and many of these other places that paul spread the gospel, becomes centers of christianity. now to emphasize the importance of paul to christianity, this is a listing of the books of the bible. jesus, his life and teachings, is primarily coming from the gospels, right here. most of what i told you in this video, this is excerpts from the fifth book of the new testament, acts of the apostles. then, most modern orderings of the bible, the next several, or many books, are called epistles, or letters. they're primarily the epistles of paul, letters that he wrote to his followers in different places. you can see most of these names, these are cities that you see where paul was a missionary. corinthians, corinth is right here, these are letters that paul is sending to the church there. galatians, you see galatia right over here in central modern day turkey. ephesians in ephesus, philippians in philippi, right over here, colossians in colossae, thessalonians in thessalonica, right over here. this is a major chunk of the bible that is either written by paul, or some people think it was written by paul, or is ascribed to paul. what i have here in this deeper orange, these are the books that historians think were actually written by paul. this lighter orange, there are some debate, and the yellow ones are the ones where people think it probably wasn't written by paul. as you can imagine, this is a significant chunk of the new testament that was actually written or ascribed to paul. he was really the significant missionary that created the christian faith beyond the jewish people.. the title of the content is the spread of christianity","- [Instructor] The central figure in Christianity is, clearly, Jesus, but it's important to note that he does not establish the religion all by himself. In fact, at the time if his crucifixion, and, according to Christian beliefs, resurrection and ascension, the number of followers he has numbers in the low hundreds. The actual work of spreading and creating the church falls on his disciples, and, particular, the ones that are referred to as apostles. When we looked at the Gospels, which are the life and teachings of Jesus Christ, the first four books of the New Testament, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, we talk about the 12 disciples, those primary followers of Jesus. They're often referred to as the 12 Apostles, as well, because according to Christian beliefs, between the resurrection and the ascension of Jesus, he tells the apostles, look, go spread the word. Apostle comes from Greek for the one who spreads the word. These were the first Christian missionaries. Now, first amongst these apostles is often considered Peter. This is Peter, right over here. He is mentioned in the Gospels. He is beside Jesus at the time of the Transfiguration. Amongst Roman Catholics, he is viewed as the first Pope, and he is really the head of the church of the Christian followers, and they're not even called Christians at this point, in Jerusalem, right over here. But we're gonna talk about another significant apostle, as well, in this video, and that is Paul. As we'll see, Paul is not mentioned in the first four books of the Bible, he wasn't a contemporary of Jesus, or, at least, he didn't know Jesus during his life. He did live at the same time, and you can see it on this timeline where Jesus is born slightly before the Common Era, I start at year one, because there isn't a year zero, and you can see that Peter is born, historians believe, around 1 AD, and Paul would have been born shortly after that. What's interesting about Paul is, Paul starts his life as a very conservative Pharisee. He starts his life persecuting Christian people, and then he has a fairly dramatic switch. You'll often hear Paul, or you might also hear the name Saul, or Paul of Tarsus, these are all referring to the same person. Tarsus is right over here, in modern day Southern Turkey. Paul, as I mentioned, he grows up in a conservative Jewish family, but he also has Roman citizenship. That's why he has this Roman name, Paul, and he has his Hebrew name, Saul. He's educated in Jerusalem. He doesn't enter into the story until we get to the fifth book of the New Testament, the Acts of the Apostles. The Acts of the Apostles talks a lot about Peter, how he spreads the church, how he is persecuted, how he performs various miracles, but it also is where we get introduced to Paul. When we first see him, as I mentioned, he is persecuting Christians. As this Church of Jerusalem starts to get established, Peter puts a fellow by the name of Stephen in charge of distributing alms to widows that are coming to them. Stephen, and this is a narrative that you'll hear often in the New Testament, he starts to get on the nerves of the religious establishment, the Jewish religious establishment, who think that he's a blasphemer, that his beliefs are threatening them, and so there's this famous trial, once again, with the Sanhedrin, and the trial of Stephen. Here I have an account for him, of that trial, or near the end of that trial, from the book of Acts, and during that trial Stephen goes into this long account of what the teachings of Jesus are, and how they're justified by what is mentioned in the Old Testament. He actually does a fairly long account of it. He also is fairly rebellious. He says, look, you, the establishment, what prophet have you not persecuted before? This really angers them, and so we read from the book of Acts, they all rushed at him, dragged him out of the city, and began to stone him. Meanwhile, the witnesses lay their coats at the feet of a young man named Saul, and we see him right over here, depicted in this painting. Saul approved of their killing him. On that day, a great persecution broke out against the church in Jerusalem. All except the apostles were scattered throughout Judea and Samaria. Godly men buried Stephen and mourned deeply for him. But Saul began to destroy the church. Going from house to house, he dragged off both men and women and put them in prison. He is a pretty fervent persecutor of Christians. It goes even further. Then, we read, we go on to read in the book of Acts, Meanwhile, Saul was still breathing out murderous threats against the Lord's disciples. He went to the high priest and asked him for letters to the synagogues in Damascus, so that if he found any there who belonged to the Way, whether men or women, he might take them as prisoners to Jerusalem. As he neared Damascus on his journey, so this is going to be interesting thing. He's so fervent, he goes to the high priest, and says, I wanna persecute these Christians wherever they are. I wanna go to Damascus, and see if I can persecute them there. As he neared Damascus on his journey, suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him. He fell to the ground and heard a voice say to him, ""Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?"" This is an image of that, this narrative in the Bible. ""Who are you, Lord?"", Saul asked. ""I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting,"" he replied. ""Now get up and go into the city,"" the city being Damascus, ""and you will be told what you must do."" Paul is blinded by this event. He's blind for three days. He goes to Damascus, and he is healed by a follower of Christ. At that moment, he completely does a 180. He goes from being one of the chief persecutors of the Christians, to being one of the chief believers, and he starts to aggressively spread the faith. So that brings us, so let's go to this map, because what's significant about Paul is Peter was, you can really view him as the first head of the church, especially after Jesus, but he primarily viewed it as something to spread amongst the Jewish people. There are events, for example, in Acts where he does realize, hey, maybe I should be, the word of Jesus should go beyond the Jewish people. It should go to the non-Jews, who are referred to as Gentiles. But Paul, and you can see on the map here, he has this revelation, I guess you could say, as he's approaching Damascus. He goes back to Jerusalem, and he tries to convince the other followers, and you can imagine they're quite skeptical of this person who is shortly before persecuting them. But he eventually convinces them, and he goes on multiple missionary journeys, spreading the faith. His center of operations is at Antioch, and he's a significant figure who helps build the church at Antioch. What's interesting about the Church of Antioch, it ends up being a very significant church, is that at Antioch, the Christians, or the Christian faith, is not just spread to the Jewish people, they're spread to the non-Jews, to the Gentiles. It's actually at the Church of Antioch that the followers of Jesus Christ, according to Biblical accounts, were first referred to as Christians. What you see on this map, here, are the various missionary journeys that Paul, who is a Roman citizen, was able, or Saul, depending on which name you want to use, was able to do through, especially the Eastern Roman Empire. In that mid 40s here, let me, in the mid 40s, right over here, he does a missionary journey. Once again, Antioch is his base, he goes to Cyprus, and southern, mid, what we would call Turkey today. In the early 50s, he goes on this fairly long journey through modern day Turkey, through Macedonia, through Greece. As he's doing this, he's spreading the word of Jesus Christ. He's starting to help establish churches in these significant places, Philippi, Thessalonica, Corinth, all of these various places. You see his third journey, here, very similar in path in yellow to the second journey. He does that in the late 50s CE. Once again, he's constantly establishing these churches. The important thing to realize about Paul, it's a controversy. To what degree should the teachings of Jesus be spread to the Gentiles, to the non-Jewish people? There are these famous debates, and Paul's view is, no, we should not force the Gentiles to do everything that the Jews have to do, the circumcision, the Jewish dietary laws. You could imagine, this doubly angers the church leaders. Not only is he spreading the word of Jesus, that has annoyed them to no end, but he also wants to spread it to the Gentiles, but he doesn't think that the Gentiles need to perform all of the things that the Jewish leaders believe are dictated by the laws of Moses, by the Jewish faith. And circumcision is actually a major debate. Circumcision, the dietary habits, et cetera, et cetera. Eventually, he goes back to Jerusalem to face this leadership, and now this is in the early 60s, and they, once again, they put him on trial. As a Jewish citizen, he says, hey, I have a right to see the Emperor. He is taken to Rome, and along the way they get caught in a storm, but eventually he makes his way to Rome, where he is held prisoner. It is believed that both Peter and Paul were killed by Nero. We talk in previous videos, the fire in 64 CE in Rome that destroys a large chunk of the city. Some people think Nero actually set the fire to clear some land so that he could build his palace. He famously blames the fire on Christians. There's a large purge of Christians that occur after that. A lot of accounts say that Peter was crucified by Nero. He requests, according to these accounts, to be crucified upside down, because he doesn't deserve to get the same crucifixion as Jesus, and Paul, some accounts say, that he was beheaded. Once again, they're dying in these Christian purges that Nero is performing. You can see it right over here, if those accounts are true. Now it's really interesting, I already talked about Paul being this missionary to the Gentiles. He is the one, especially at the Church of Antioch, where Christianity starts to really separate from Judaism, starts to become a faith in it's own right. That was even further accelerated in a few years after their death, or it might have been roughly coincident with their death, depending on when their deaths were. From 66 to 70, you have the Jewish rebellion, sometimes called the First Roman-Jewish War, and it ends with the Roman Empire destroying the temple at Jerusalem, the center of the Jewish faith. The second temple of Jerusalem, the one that was rebuilt, partially, by Cyrus the Great. So this causes the Jewish people to have to leave, and they no longer have this center of their people. You have the Jewish diaspora that gets spread throughout the Roman Empire, and other empires, like the Parthians in Persia. They really, there's a famous battle in 73 of Masada, this mountain fortress, where the Romans, essentially, well, it's a mass suicide, but it's this bloody extermination of the Jewish people in and around Jerusalem, so they are spread. That's, obviously, a significant series of events for the Jewish people, but it's also significant for Christianity, because Jerusalem was a center of the Christian faith. Now the Christian followers are going to be spread around, and many of these other places that Paul spread the Gospel, becomes centers of Christianity. Now to emphasize the importance of Paul to Christianity, this is a listing of the books of the Bible. Jesus, his life and teachings, is primarily coming from the Gospels, right here. Most of what I told you in this video, this is excerpts from the fifth book of the New Testament, Acts of the Apostles. Then, most modern orderings of the Bible, the next several, or many books, are called epistles, or letters. They're primarily the epistles of Paul, letters that he wrote to his followers in different places. You can see most of these names, these are cities that you see where Paul was a missionary. Corinthians, Corinth is right here, these are letters that Paul is sending to the church there. Galatians, you see Galatia right over here in central modern day Turkey. Ephesians in Ephesus, Philippians in Philippi, right over here, Colossians in Colossae, Thessalonians in Thessalonica, right over here. This is a major chunk of the Bible that is either written by Paul, or some people think it was written by Paul, or is ascribed to Paul. What I have here in this deeper orange, these are the books that historians think were actually written by Paul. This lighter orange, there are some debate, and the yellow ones are the ones where people think it probably wasn't written by Paul. As you can imagine, this is a significant chunk of the New Testament that was actually written or ascribed to Paul. He was really the significant missionary that created the Christian faith beyond the Jewish people.",Early Christianity,Khan Academy (English - CBSE India Curriculum) >> Arts and humanities >> World history >> 600 BCE - 600 CE Second-Wave Civilizations >> Early Christianity,"christianity starts as a jewish sect on the periphery of the roman empire. despite being actively persecuted, the religion grows through the empire, eventually becoming the official state religion.. this is the topic tree khan academy (english - cbse india curriculum) >> arts and humanities >> world history >>  bce -  ce second-wave civilizations >> early christianity",video

it feels like it's semantic, which is really debating around the meaning of words. but, at the end of the roman empire and as we get into the middle ages, this was a major issue of philosophical and it would sometimes bleed over into political debate. and so constantine, who we mentioned has a sympathy towards the christians, he allows christianity to be tolerated, he does not like this idea of this debate and he wants to help unify the christians. so, in  he calls the council of nicaea, to help resolve this controversy, which gets known as the arian controversy, named after arius of alexandria. now it's worth mentioning, arius wasn't the first person to make this argument, that the father in some way was more divine than the son, because he begat the son, he existed before the son. but this controversy really revolves around arius, because he was especially persuasive about spreading this view of the relationship between the father and the son, manifested by jesus. and at the council of nicaea, many of the bishops throughout christendom are in attendance, it's known as the first ecumenical conference, the word ecumenical comes from the greek word for the inhabited earth. so you can view it as the church leaders from the inhabited earth, in order to create a consensus about what it means to be a christian. and arius of alexandria was there to defend his position, but the majority of those there did not like his point of view. so they declared arius' beliefs as heresy and they exile him. and to be very clear that they do not believe that the son is of a different substance of the father, they issue the nicene creed. so what i have here, this is known as the nicene-constantinopolitan creed. and this is based on the nicene creed, which was established in , which was shorter, but then in , under theodosius, you have your second ecumenical council, which is held in constantinople, to reaffirm some of the ideas of the nicene council. and so as i read this, keep a look out for some of these words, which were really put there to try to settle the arian controversy, to try to ensure that that type of belief does not surface again. we believe in one god, the father almighty, maker of heaven and earth, and of all things visible and invisible. and in one lord jesus christ, the son of god, the only-begotten, begotten of the father before all ages. so, not like arius was arguing, that there was a time where the father existed before the son existed. here it says begotten of the father, but before all ages, so there was always a time when there was a son. light of light, very god of very god, begotten, not made; of one essence with the father, by whom all things were made. so, once again, really addressing this arian controversy, the arian heresy as it becomes known, that the father and the son are of the same essence, one is not more divine than the other. who for us men and for our salvation came down from heaven, and was incarnate of the holy spirit and the virgin mary, and was made man. and was crucified also for us under pontius pilate, and suffered, and was buried. and the third day he rose again, according to the scriptures. and ascended into heaven, and sits at the right hand of the father. and he shall come again with glory to judge the living and the dead, whose kingdom shall have no end. and we believe in the holy spirit, the lord, and giver of life, who proceeds from the father. now here in brackets i've written filoque and the son? because even though the official nicene- constantinopolitan creed just says who proceeds from the father, as we will see later on, as the church starts to become more and more divided, in the west, in latin, the term filoque gets added, which means and the son. and, once again, this is starting to address this notion of how does the son relate to the father? so, when you add filoque, you're saying, hey, the holy spirit is emanating from both the father and the son, versus just the father, but we'll get into that. this was not a matter of debate in the  century, but it will become a matter of debate as we go into the  century and beyond. and we believe in the holy spirit, the lord, and giver of life, who proceeds from the father. who with the father and the son together is worshiped and glorified, who spoke by the prophets. and we believe in one, holy, catholic, meaning universal, and apostolic church. we acknowledge one baptism for the remission of sins. we look for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the age to come, amen. so this is interesting, because it's, you can view it as a unification of christendom. now, as we will see, that unification does not hold well over the next several hundred years. even though arius is exiled and he dies shortly thereafter, you continue to have sympathetic bishops and even roman emperors, to the arian doctrine. you also, this debate between the relation of the father and the son continues, we'll talk about this filoque debate. but maybe most important and the biggest cause of the eventual divisions between the church, ones that carry on even to today, it's really about a power struggle. so, as we've been talking about the late roman empire and even the fall of the western empire and the beginning of the byzantine empire, you might already notice that there are several very powerful actors here. with the fall of the western roman empire, you have the byzantine emperor, who considers him, and as we'll see, also herself, the roman emperor. we have the bishop, the patriarch, or, often known, the pope of rome. now rome is significant, because according to tradition the church at rome was founded by the apostle peter, who is considered by many to be the first amongst the apostles. but of course rome was the seat of the roman empire for a very, very, very long time. and so you could imagine the bishop of the church of rome, the pope of rome would be a very powerful figure. now you also have the bishop or the patriarch of constantinople, which is another capital and really the capital of the byzantine empire. and so what we're going to see, over the next several hundred years, is the jockeying for position amongst these three, in particular the byzantine emperor and the pope of rome. the pope of rome starts to consider themselves as really the leader of all of christendom. the patriarch of constantinople and the bishops of the other major centers of christianity, like antioch and jerusalem and alexandria, they view themselves as all kind of a college of, as peers and they will give extra space for the pope of rome or the bishop of rome, because of the importance of that city and the significance of how the church of rome was founded. and this gets, this jockeying for power over the next several hundred years gets even more complex as the west, what was the western roman empire, or some of the areas of the western roman empire, start to get consolidated under germanic rule really, frankish rule and you start having this notion of a holy roman emperor that we'll talk about in a few hundred years down our timeline. so, keep a look out for this power struggle. we're going to talk about particular issues of theological doctrine, things like the filoque issue, things like the relationship between the father and the son, whether you should have icons. but, at the end of the day, what's eventually going to lead to the great schism, in the beginning of the second millennium, is this power struggle.. the title of the content is the council of nicaea","- [Instructor] In previous videos, we have talked about how Christianity evolved and developed under the Roman Empire. In particular we saw that as we entered into the 4th century, that Christianity continued to be persecuted, in particular by the Emperor Diocletian, who had some of the worst persecutions of the Christians. But over the course of the next century, from roughly 300 to 400, the relationship between the Roman Empire and Christianity goes completely in the opposite direction. As Constantine takes over, he becomes sympathetic to the Christians and he eventually becomes Christian himself. Even then, there was a lot of diversity within the Christian Church. There were debates about the nature of Jesus Christ relative to the Father, relative to the Holy Spirit. There were multiple sects of Christianity. And one in particular started to create a debate. There was a priest in Alexandria, which was one of the major cities of the Roman Empire. Now remember, by this point, Rome of course is one of the most significant, if not the most significant city. Now Constantine sets up a capital at Byzantium, which will eventually be known as Constantinople. And Alexandria, which was originally founded by Alexander the Great, is also one of the significant cities of the Empire. And in Alexandria there is a Christian priest by the name of Arius, who has a view on Christ that becomes a bit of a controversy. And to understand that, here is an account of his writings, or his beliefs. So this is Arius of Alexandria. If the Father begat the Son, he that was begotten had a beginning of existence: and from this it is evident, that there was a time when the Son was not. It therefore necessarily follows that He, the Son, had his substance from nothing. So, he's drawing a distinction between the essence of the Father and the Son, who's manifested as Jesus Christ. Now this is very controversial, because even his own bishop in Alexandria viewed the Father and the Son to be of the same substance. Now, today, you might say, hey, isn't this just word play? It feels like it's semantic, which is really debating around the meaning of words. But, at the end of the Roman Empire and as we get into the Middle Ages, this was a major issue of philosophical and it would sometimes bleed over into political debate. And so Constantine, who we mentioned has a sympathy towards the Christians, he allows Christianity to be tolerated, he does not like this idea of this debate and he wants to help unify the Christians. So, in 325 he calls the Council of Nicaea, to help resolve this controversy, which gets known as the Arian Controversy, named after Arius of Alexandria. Now it's worth mentioning, Arius wasn't the first person to make this argument, that the Father in some way was more divine than the Son, because He begat the Son, He existed before the Son. But this controversy really revolves around Arius, because he was especially persuasive about spreading this view of the relationship between the Father and the Son, manifested by Jesus. And at the Council of Nicaea, many of the bishops throughout Christendom are in attendance, it's known as the First Ecumenical Conference, the word ecumenical comes from the Greek word for the inhabited Earth. So you can view it as the Church leaders from the inhabited Earth, in order to create a consensus about what it means to be a Christian. And Arius of Alexandria was there to defend his position, but the majority of those there did not like his point of view. So they declared Arius' beliefs as heresy and they exile him. And to be very clear that they do not believe that the Son is of a different substance of the Father, they issue the Nicene Creed. So what I have here, this is known as the Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed. And this is based on the Nicene Creed, which was established in 325, which was shorter, but then in 381, under Theodosius, you have your Second Ecumenical Council, which is held in Constantinople, to reaffirm some of the ideas of the Nicene Council. And so as I read this, keep a look out for some of these words, which were really put there to try to settle the Arian Controversy, to try to ensure that that type of belief does not surface again. We believe in one God, the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth, and of all things visible and invisible. And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the Only-begotten, Begotten of the Father before all ages. So, not like Arius was arguing, that there was a time where the Father existed before the Son existed. Here it says begotten of the Father, but before all ages, so there was always a time when there was a Son. Light of Light, Very God of Very God, Begotten, not made; of one essence with the Father, by whom all things were made. So, once again, really addressing this Arian Controversy, the Arian Heresy as it becomes known, that the Father and the Son are of the same essence, one is not more divine than the other. Who for us men and for our salvation came down from heaven, and was incarnate of the Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary, and was made man. And was crucified also for us under Pontius Pilate, and suffered, and was buried. And the third day He rose again, according to the Scriptures. And ascended into heaven, and sits at the right hand of the Father. And He shall come again with glory to judge the living and the dead, Whose kingdom shall have no end. And we believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, and Giver of Life, Who proceeds from the Father. Now here in brackets I've written filoque and the son? Because even though the official Nicene- Constantinopolitan Creed just says Who proceeds from the Father, as we will see later on, as the Church starts to become more and more divided, in the West, in Latin, the term filoque gets added, which means and the son. And, once again, this is starting to address this notion of how does the Son relate to the Father? So, when you add filoque, you're saying, hey, the Holy Spirit is emanating from both the Father and the Son, versus just the Father, but we'll get into that. This was not a matter of debate in the 4th century, but it will become a matter of debate as we go into the 6th century and beyond. And we believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, and Giver of Life, Who proceeds from the Father. Who with the Father and the Son together is worshiped and glorified, Who spoke by the Prophets. And we believe in one, holy, catholic, meaning universal, and apostolic Church. We acknowledge one Baptism for the remission of sins. We look for the Resurrection of the dead, and the life of the age to come, Amen. So this is interesting, because it's, you can view it as a unification of Christendom. Now, as we will see, that unification does not hold well over the next several hundred years. Even though Arius is exiled and he dies shortly thereafter, you continue to have sympathetic bishops and even Roman Emperors, to the Arian Doctrine. You also, this debate between the relation of the Father and the Son continues, we'll talk about this filoque debate. But maybe most important and the biggest cause of the eventual divisions between the Church, ones that carry on even to today, it's really about a power struggle. So, as we've been talking about the late Roman Empire and even the fall of the Western Empire and the beginning of the Byzantine Empire, you might already notice that there are several very powerful actors here. With the fall of the Western Roman Empire, you have the Byzantine Emperor, who considers him, and as we'll see, also herself, the Roman Emperor. We have the Bishop, the Patriarch, or, often known, the Pope of Rome. Now Rome is significant, because according to tradition the Church at Rome was founded by the Apostle Peter, who is considered by many to be the first amongst the Apostles. But of course Rome was the seat of the Roman Empire for a very, very, very long time. And so you could imagine the Bishop of the Church of Rome, the Pope of Rome would be a very powerful figure. Now you also have the Bishop or the Patriarch of Constantinople, which is another capital and really the capital of the Byzantine Empire. And so what we're going to see, over the next several hundred years, is the jockeying for position amongst these three, in particular the Byzantine Emperor and the Pope of Rome. The Pope of Rome starts to consider themselves as really the leader of all of Christendom. The Patriarch of Constantinople and the bishops of the other major centers of Christianity, like Antioch and Jerusalem and Alexandria, they view themselves as all kind of a college of, as peers and they will give extra space for the Pope of Rome or the Bishop of Rome, because of the importance of that city and the significance of how the Church of Rome was founded. And this gets, this jockeying for power over the next several hundred years gets even more complex as the West, what was the Western Roman Empire, or some of the areas of the Western Roman Empire, start to get consolidated under Germanic rule really, Frankish rule and you start having this notion of a Holy Roman Emperor that we'll talk about in a few hundred years down our timeline. So, keep a look out for this power struggle. We're going to talk about particular issues of theological doctrine, things like the filoque issue, things like the relationship between the Father and the Son, whether you should have icons. But, at the end of the day, what's eventually going to lead to the Great Schism, in the beginning of the Second Millennium, is this power struggle.",Early Christianity,Khan Academy (English - US curriculum) >> Arts and humanities >> World history >> 600 BCE - 600 CE Second-Wave Civilizations >> Early Christianity,"christianity starts as a jewish sect on the periphery of the roman empire. despite being actively persecuted, the religion grows through the empire, eventually becoming the official state religion.. this is the topic tree khan academy (english - us curriculum) >> arts and humanities >> world history >>  bce -  ce second-wave civilizations >> early christianity",video

from the time of jesus to the reign of theodosius.  . - [narrator] as we've talked about in multiple videos, christianity is a religion that grew out of the fringes of the roman empire. it starts as a jewish sect in judea and galilee with the teachings of jesus and his early ministry. but it's important to keep in mind that at the time of jesus's crucifixion, around  c.e., he only had, at most, we're talking about in the hundreds of followers. but in other videos, we talk about his apostles who start spreading the faith, not only to other jews, but also to non-jews, to gentiles. we talked about emperor nero and his famous purges of christians, in particular, you have the famous roman fire, or the fire of rome in  c.e. that nero blames on christians, and he uses this to do significant purge in rome. many historians believe that the apostles peter and paul were killed during those purges. this is a painting of nero using christians lighting them alive to punish them for that fire. now, other imperial acts that continue to have a significant effect on this very early christian church. we talked about the destroying of the second temple in jerusalem in  c.e., and that's under the reign of vespasian. and this of course is a very significant event for the jewish people, but it also has a significant effect on christianity, because remember christianity was really centered at jerusalem. it was a sect of christianity, or it was, it got its start as a sect of christianity, but now, with the destruction of the temple, the jews were dispersed from jerusalem, and so were many of these early christians. and so the centers of christianity became throughout the empire, places like antioch. and you continue to have a discomfort with christians especially as they became more and more in number, and they started to have more and more power. and here you have these people who refused to obey the roman gods, to do their rituals, to worship the roman gods, and remember, even, there was emperor worship here. and the issue was more so than even the jewish people, who, to a certain degree, kept to themselves, these christians were missionaries. they were spreading their faith to roman citizens. families were being split apart, where some decided to become christians and no longer follow these roman practices. and so you have these various persecutions, and these various purges, and they get more and more significant as you go into the second and even to some degree in the third century as christians become more and more prominent and more and more in number. remember, they have this missionary zeal, and it really becomes a significant purge under the reign of diocletian. in previous videos, we talk about diocletian. he's the one that famously split the empire between east and west, but he's also famous for his purge of the christians. the most extreme state-sponsored purges of christians in the roman empire. but what's interesting is right after, or shortly after those purges, we're talking a few decades here, the next empire that would, the next emperor who would have reign over the entire roman empire, would be constantine, and at least relative to christians, he would be the opposite of diocletian, because as he's trying to consolidate his power in  c.e., you have the famous battle at the milvian bridge outside of, or entering into rome. and in this battle, constantine, he sees a vision of the christian cross centered on the sun, and he thinks that that is a sign that he should fight under the cross. and he gets the symbols painted on his soldier's sealed, and he's victorious. this date, , milvian bridge, the battle at milvian bridge, is viewed as the beginning of constantine's conversion to christianity, viewing it as his chosen faith. in , the roman emperor, or the empire, issues the edict of milan, which officially makes christianity ok. it legalizes christianity, which is a big deal, because these folks have been persecuted all this time. they haven't been worshiping the roman gods. then in , constantine goes even further, and he convenes the council of nicea, where he brings the bishops from all of christendom together, to start having a more unified belief system. they come up with a nicean creed. a lot of the debate is whether jesus, as son of god, should be considered equal to god or as god or a little less, as being the son, maybe if he is the son, maybe there was a time where there wasn't a son, and there was just god, but the nicean creed says no, they are one and the same, these two things are equivalent. and then constantine, on his death bed, famously gets baptized, and becomes a christian, the first christian emperor of this gigantic roman empire. and so you can imagine, you have more and more followers of christianity, but now, this is, so to speak, prime time. the emperor of the roman, the emperor of the roman empire has converted to christianity, and it's a legalized religion. and then that gets even more momentum when we get to the end of the fourth century. emperor theodosius, who is christian, under him, it becomes the official religion of the roman empire, the same empire that at one point, christianity was illegal, and it was being persecuted, now it was the official religion of the roman empire. theodosius, i mention him in other videos, he was incidentally also the last emperor to rule over both eastern and western roman empires. so you have this empire that starts off very anti-christian, actually in the beginning, they don't really take much note of what's going on in judea and galilee, but more and more, they start to persecute them. but we go a few hundred years into this, and it becomes a christian empire.. the title of the content is christianity in the roman empire","- [Narrator] As we've talked about in multiple videos, Christianity is a religion that grew out of the fringes of the Roman Empire. It starts as a Jewish sect in Judea and Galilee with the teachings of Jesus and his early ministry. But it's important to keep in mind that at the time of Jesus's crucifixion, around 30 C.E., he only had, at most, we're talking about in the hundreds of followers. But in other videos, we talk about his apostles who start spreading the faith, not only to other Jews, but also to non-Jews, to gentiles. We talked about Emperor Nero and his famous purges of Christians, in particular, you have the famous Roman Fire, or The Fire of Rome in 64 C.E. that Nero blames on Christians, and he uses this to do significant purge in Rome. Many historians believe that the apostles Peter and Paul were killed during those purges. This is a painting of Nero using Christians lighting them alive to punish them for that fire. Now, other imperial acts that continue to have a significant effect on this very early Christian church. We talked about the destroying of the second temple in Jerusalem in 70 C.E., and that's under the reign of Vespasian. And this of course is a very significant event for the Jewish people, but it also has a significant effect on Christianity, because remember Christianity was really centered at Jerusalem. It was a sect of Christianity, or it was, it got its start as a sect of Christianity, but now, with the destruction of the temple, the Jews were dispersed from Jerusalem, and so were many of these early Christians.

But what's interesting is right after, or shortly after those purges, we're talking a few decades here, the next empire that would, the next emperor who would have reign over the entire Roman Empire, would be Constantine, and at least relative to Christians, he would be the opposite of Diocletian, because as he's trying to consolidate his power in 312 C.E., you have the famous battle at the Milvian Bridge outside of, or entering into Rome. And in this battle, Constantine, he sees a vision of the Christian cross centered on the sun, and he thinks that that is a sign that he should fight under the cross. And he gets the symbols painted on his soldier's sealed, and he's victorious. This date, 312, Milvian Bridge, The Battle at Milvian Bridge, is viewed as the beginning of Constantine's conversion to Christianity, viewing it as his chosen faith. In 313, the Roman emperor, or the empire, issues the edict of Milan, which officially makes Christianity OK. It legalizes Christianity, which is a big deal, because these folks have been persecuted all this time. They haven't been worshiping the Roman gods. Then in 325, Constantine goes even further, and he convenes the council of Nicea, where he brings the bishops from all of Christendom together, to start having a more unified belief system. They come up with a Nicean creed. A lot of the debate is whether Jesus, as son of God, should be considered equal to God or as God or a little less, as being the son, maybe if he is the son, maybe there was a time where there wasn't a son, and there was just God, but the Nicean Creed says no, they are one and the same, these two things are equivalent.

Emperor Theodosius, who is Christian, under him, it becomes the official religion of the Roman Empire, the same empire that at one point, Christianity was illegal, and it was being persecuted, now it was the official religion of the Roman Empire. Theodosius, I mention him in other videos, he was incidentally also the last emperor to rule over both Eastern and Western Roman Empires. So you have this empire that starts off very anti-Christian, actually in the beginning, they don't really take much note of what's going on in Judea and Galilee, but more and more, they start to persecute them.

now, charlemagne considers himself something of a protector of christianity, and pope leo iii goes to him for protection, and charlemagne is able to actually provide it. and in exchange, or perhaps in thanks for that, the pope crowns charlemagne as holy roman emperor. now, what's significant about this is it really introduces a fourth actor here, because the title holy roman emperor was intentionally given to say, look, now you, charlemagne, you are the heir to the grandeur of rome. you are the heir to the roman emperors. now, you might be saying, wait, isn't that what the byzantine emperors thought they were? didn't they think this was the roman empire? and at that time, their emperor was an empress. it was empress irene of athens. and so once again, this is creating further tension. they're using different languages, latin versus greek. you now have the western pope recognizing a different, i guess you could say, roman emperor in charlemagne. the nature of the west is becoming more germanic, and using the language latin, while the nature of the east is continuing in greek traditions. on top of that, what you have in the year , you're actually in this period where you've had several conflicts over this notion of iconoclasm. this iconoclasm movement, you could say, started in  when the byzantine emperor said, enough of these images of jesus and the virgin mary and other figures of christianity in our churches, citing references in the old testament saying that hey, we shouldn't have these images. and so this iconoclasm or these destroying of icons starts to begin. well, the pope in the west, they say, hey, we don't think we have to listen to you. i am the bishop of rome. i have universal jurisdiction. and then to add insult to injury, now, in , you have charlemagne being crowned holy roman emperor. now, a thread further running through this is something we've talked about in a previous video, this notion of filioque, where in , the council of constantinople, they augment the nicene creed where they say, and we believe in the holy spirit, the lord and giver of life who proceeds from the father. well, in the west, they add the latin term filioque, which means and the son. this is touching on some of these notions in the arian heresy where, where does the holy spirit proceed from, if the father and son are really co-divine, co-equal, of the same substance, shouldn't the holy spirit proceed from both rather than just one? well, those in the east said, hey, this isn't what we agreed to, while those in the west say, hey, we don't think it's so important that you agree to things, because we have the seat at rome, the seat that was established by peter.. the title of the content is great schism or east-west schism part ","- [Instructor] In previous videos, we talked about the dramatic turnaround in the fourth century in terms of how Christianity was treated in the Roman Empire. As you enter into the fourth century, it's persecuted by Diocletian, but then Constantine takes power. He's sympathetic to the Christians. He even convenes them in order to unify the Christians, to have a more unified sense of what it means to be Christian, in order to settle things like the Arian Controversy, and he converts himself to Christianity. And as we exit the fourth century, you have Theodosius, who makes Christianity the official religion of the Roman Empire and then begins to persecute other religions. Now, what we're going to do in this video is continue the narrative, and in particular, we're going to see how there's an evolution between the church in the west and the church in the east. In previous videos, we already talk about how the Roman Empire itself is initially administered between west and east, and then that administration becomes more and more formal. Theodosius is the last emperor to truly rule both halves. They start getting ruled separately. And as you get into the latter half of the fifth century, the western empire itself falls to Germanic conquerors. Now, in previous videos, we talk about how the emperors who rule from Constantinople consider themselves to continue the Roman Empire. They didn't call themselves the Byzantine Empire, as we now call them. They call themselves the Roman Empire. They considered themselves Roman emperors. The west falls, as I just mentioned, into a bunch of Germanic kingdoms. Justinian is able to reclaim a lot of the land formerly lost in the western Roman Empire. Now, there's some other interesting actors we see emerging on this map, and once again, we're now in the sixth century. You have these Germanic tribes, the Visigothic kingdoms here in modern-day Spain, and here in modern-day France, you have the Franks. And the word France really is referring to land of the Franks, another Germanic tribe. Now, they are able to factor much, much more relevantly. And when I say about, I'm saying over the next several hundred years in this eventual division, culturally and religiously, between east and west. As I mentioned in previous videos, the division, yes, it will center on notions of language. In the west, especially in the church, Latin is used. In the east, in the church, Greek is used. There are spiritual debates that we will touch on in a few minutes, but there's also a power struggle. You have the Byzantine Emperor seated in Constantinople. You have the Bishop of Rome, now known as the Pope, the Pope of Rome, who considers themselves more and more the leader of all of Christianity, and their argument there is look, this is the church that, according to tradition, was founded by Peter, first amongst the apostles. You have the patriarch of Constantinople and patriarchs of other significant centers of Christianity that say wait, hold on a second. Yes, Bishop of Rome, you are very important. But we consider you to be first amongst equals. You don't have jurisdiction over all of Christendom. Together we have jurisdiction. And this was, to some degree, the case under Justinian, and it was very clear at this time that the Byzantine emperor was very powerful, not just over the temporal realm, really referring to the day-to-day material realm, but also a lot of influence on the spiritual realm, which was really supposed to be the domain of the bishops or the popes or the patriarchs. This notion of the pentarchy was codified in the Justinian law, this idea that these five centers of Christianity really have extra weight and collectively are really leading Christendom. Now, as I mentioned, things get interesting as we fast forward about 250 years. So let's go to the year 800. So, one thing you might notice is that group in yellow, the Franks, have now conquered a lot more, and they're conquering it under the leadership of Charlemagne. At the same time, you see this green over here. Islam has dramatically spread from its founding in the early seventh century, all the way now as we're exiting the eighth century, to cover most of the Middle East, Persia, bordering on modern-day Pakistan, India, north Africa, and even going into modern-day Spain. At the same time, especially because of these Islamic conquests, the Byzantine Empire and the Byzantine emperor is significantly weaker. So you can imagine the pope in Rome here saying, well, who's going to protect me, especially from my political enemies? Now, Charlemagne considers himself something of a protector of Christianity, and Pope Leo III goes to him for protection, and Charlemagne is able to actually provide it. And in exchange, or perhaps in thanks for that, the pope crowns Charlemagne as Holy Roman Emperor. Now, what's significant about this is it really introduces a fourth actor here, because the title Holy Roman Emperor was intentionally given to say, look, now you, Charlemagne, you are the heir to the grandeur of Rome. You are the heir to the Roman emperors. Now, you might be saying, wait, isn't that what the Byzantine emperors thought they were? Didn't they think this was the Roman Empire? And at that time, their emperor was an empress. It was Empress Irene of Athens. And so once again, this is creating further tension. They're using different languages, Latin versus Greek. You now have the western pope recognizing a different, I guess you could say, Roman emperor in Charlemagne. The nature of the west is becoming more Germanic, and using the language Latin, while the nature of the east is continuing in Greek traditions. On top of that, what you have in the year 800, you're actually in this period where you've had several conflicts over this notion of iconoclasm. This iconoclasm movement, you could say, started in 726 when the Byzantine emperor said, enough of these images of Jesus and the Virgin Mary and other figures of Christianity in our churches, citing references in the Old Testament saying that hey, we shouldn't have these images. And so this iconoclasm or these destroying of icons starts to begin. Well, the pope in the west, they say, hey, we don't think we have to listen to you. I am the Bishop of Rome. I have universal jurisdiction. And then to add insult to injury, now, in 800, you have Charlemagne being crowned Holy Roman Emperor. Now, a thread further running through this is something we've talked about in a previous video, this notion of filioque, where in 381, the Council of Constantinople, they augment the Nicene Creed where they say, and we believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord and Giver of Life who proceeds from the Father. Well, in the west, they add the Latin term filioque, which means and the Son. This is touching on some of these notions in the Arian Heresy where, where does the Holy Spirit proceed from, if the Father and Son are really co-divine, co-equal, of the same substance, shouldn't the Holy Spirit proceed from both rather than just one? Well, those in the east said, hey, this isn't what we agreed to, while those in the west say, hey, we don't think it's so important that you agree to things, because we have the seat at Rome, the seat that was established by Peter.",Early Christianity,Khan Academy (English - US curriculum) >> Arts and humanities >> World history >> 600 BCE - 600 CE Second-Wave Civilizations >> Early Christianity,"christianity starts as a jewish sect on the periphery of the roman empire. despite being actively persecuted, the religion grows through the empire, eventually becoming the official state religion.. this is the topic tree khan academy (english - us curriculum) >> arts and humanities >> world history >>  bce -  ce second-wave civilizations >> early christianity",video

[instructor] we're now going to talk about the beginnings of one of the most important religions in human history. and, even today, the largest religion on earth. and that, of course, is christianity. and the central figure in christianity is jesus christ. and the term christ is given to him. it is greek for savior, for messiah. because his early followers view him as the prophesized messiah, savior, for the jewish people. and his followers today view him as the savior, the messiah, for all humankind. so, you have over two billion christians who view him central to their faith. who view him as their god. but, above and beyond that, you also have over a billion muslims who view him as a significant prophet. now, just to get some context on the life and times of jesus, most of the accounts we have of him come from the first four books of the new testament of the bible called the gospel of matthew, gospel of mark, gospel of luke, gospel of john. sometimes it's the gospel according to matthew, mark, luke, or john. and the term gospel today often refers to the idea of the life and teaching of jesus christ. so, you could view it as the life and teaching of jesus christ according to matthew, according to mark, according to luke, according to john. but it really comes from old english for good news. and there is a related term, evangel. you might have heard of evangelical or evangelize. also referring to good news. now, the reason why it was considered good news is his message.... we're gonna have some examples of it in a few minutes. really talks about this idea that the poor have the kingdom of heaven waiting for them. that there's this forgiving god that you can have a close connection with. and for a lot of people... remember, this was in the time of the roman empire. most people were downtrodden. there was slavery. people who were poor. and this idea that even the poor could go to the kingdom of heaven and, in some ways, have better access to it than the rich and the powerful was good news to a lot of people. now, it's worth noting that these gospels were written several decades after, depending on what you view, the death and/or ascension of jesus christ according to christian belief. as you can see, jesus was born slightly before the year one. most historians put his birth at around four to six bce, before the common era. and they put his death around  to  ce, in the common era. you could also use the original terms, before christ and anno dominei, in the year of our lord. our modern calendar system really uses the original view of the birth of jesus as where we start anno dominei versus before christ or the common era versus before the common era. now, it's interesting that it turns out that jesus was likely born slightly before. slightly before the original view on the birth of christ. now, his birth would have been right around the time... or it would have been under the reign of emperor augustus, as we talk about in other videos. and his death would have been under the reign of emperor tiberius. and these gospels of mark, matthew, luke, and john. these are written during really hard times for the jewish people and for the early christians. you have the jewish rebellion where the second temple is destroyed by rome. you have the significant christian persecution, especially by folks like emperor nero where he blames the fire in rome on christians and he just, essentially, just kills them for fun. really just to purge them, to persecute them. and, just to understand where all of this takes place, the life and times of jesus takes place, it is in the roman empire. we're on the eastern edge of it at the eastern mediterranean right over here. this would be modern day israel and palestine for the most part. this is a zoomed in version. and jesus is born in bethlehem. and this is a scene. i'm gonna show you a lot of paintings. as you can imagine, he's a figure that has inspired a lot of paintings. this is a figure of the three magi visiting and giving their gifts to the infant jesus. magi, famously the zoroastrian priests, coming from persia to visit jesus, according to biblical accounts. and he is raised in nazareth. and that's why he's oftentimes referred to as jesus of nazareth. and the gospels don't talk a lot about his early life. they start to talk a lot about his life once he hits his late 's or early 's. and the first really significant account after his famous birth to the virgin mary. his purported father, joseph, was mary's husband, but the holy ghost or god was the actual father, making this a virgin birth. but, after that, the first significant event is really his baptism by john the baptist. john the baptist was another preacher, prophetic figure of that time. a significant one. he had a lot of followers. and he as baptizing people in the jordan river, right in that region. this is the jordan river right over here. and this is a depiction of the famous baptism of jesus by john the baptist. and, famously, john the baptist said, ""no, you should be baptizing me."" but then after jesus said, ""no, no, you baptize me."" and, after, jesus was baptized. famously the sun shines on jesus and god speaks that ""this is my son."" according to, once again, biblical accounts. and john the baptist, shortly after that, gets arrested by king herod of galilee. remember, galilee is the home region of jesus where he will eventually do most of his preaching. and, after that, jesus starts to really go full into effect in his ministry. and, while he's doing that, he's performing all of these miracles. he's healing people, turning water into wine, walking on water, bringing people back from the dead. and this is, of course, according to biblical accounts. you can decide if you believe these or not. and he does most of that in galilee. and, eventually, he makes his way down to jerusalem to meet his fate. he tells, according to the gospels, his followers, his disciples.... and there's  in particular that are called out, but he has many, many more than that. that ""look, i am going to meet my fate there, but i'm doing it willingly."" but, more than his miracles, it's interesting to look at some of what he preached. and this might give you a little bit of a sense why many people would have called this good news. so, this is from the gospel of matthew that i'm gonna quote right over here. and this first part comes from his sermon of the mount. he goes to the top of a mountain and he gives this sermon. ""blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven."" ""blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth."" ""blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy."" ""blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see god."" ""blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called sons of god."" so, all of that, if you're a peasant, if you're someone with not a lot, you're downtrodden, hard life. you're like, ""look, blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven."" you could view this as good news. ""ye have heard that it was said an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth, but i say unto you, resist not him that is evil. but whosoever smiteth thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also."" even in modern times, this is not an easy way... this is not an easy way to live. someone who's doing something to you, don't try to seek revenge. and this is a very different tone than a lot of what you might get in the old testament. ""ye have heard that it was said, thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy, but i say unto you love your enemies and pray for them that persecute you."" once again, not an easy thing to do. even in modern terms, you can view this as a very forward, very advanced way of thinking about the world. he also, beyond this idea of embracing even your enemies and not seeking revenge and that the poor have access to this kingdom of heaven, he really also liked to take it to the hypocrites, especially those who viewed themselves as the bearers of the religion. in particular, he picks on the pharisees, which was a sect of jews at the time who viewed themselves very ritualistic. remember, jesus, himself, is a jewish preacher. he's a jewish teacher. he is viewed as a rabbi himself. ""and when ye pray, ye shall not be as the hypocrites. for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and in the corners of the street that they may be seen of men."" so, these hypocrites, they pray just so other people can see how religious they are. ""verily, i say unto you, they have received their reward."" they've already gotten the credit from people for praying. ""but thou, when thou prayest, enter into thine inner chamber and, having shut thy door, pray to thy father who is in secret, and thy father, who seeth in secret shall recompense thee."" so, don't make a big deal about your prayer. do it in private and then have this personal connection with god. now, it's worth noting that, even though he preached a lot about the kingdom of heaven for the poor, prayer is a private thing, that you shouldn't try to seek revenge, you should be very conciliatory to your enemies, he did take a strong stance on what he was preaching. he did say, ""look, you gotta be with me if you want to enter into this kingdom of heaven."" he took some strong stances. this isn't gonna be an easy thing and this is gonna cause a lot of tension. this is one quote that you could view that way. once again, from the gospel of matthew, ""think not that i came to send peace on earth. i came not to send peace, but a sword. for i came to set a man at variance against his father and the daughter against her mother."" i would interpret this as saying this is gonna cause a lot of divisiveness. ""and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law. and a man's foes shall be they of his own household. he that loveth father and mother more than me is not worthy of me. and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me. and he that doth not take his cross and follow after me is not worthy of me. he that findeth his life shall lose it and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it."" so, he takes a pretty strong stance. ""look, you really need to follow me. but, if you follow me, there's some very good things that are waiting for you."" but, eventually, he does make his way... he tells his... there's other.... these miracles he's performing. this is the famous transfiguration of christ where he makes it apparent to his followers. he kind of becomes luminescent and he becomes apparent to his followers, his disciples, that he truly is the son of god. and then, he makes his way... this is the year, depending on whether you think it's , , ,  ce. he makes his way to jerusalem to meet his fate. he's already prophesized to his followers that this is gonna be a tough fate. that he's gonna die there. and this is a very important week in christianity. it's referred to as passion week. and the term passion has a different connotation. it really means the suffering of christ. this is the week that he suffers. this is the week that he gets crucified and then resurrected. so, he goes to jerusalem on sunday. this is around the time of passover. very important religious period for the jewish people. and he comes to jerusalem near passover. that sunday that he comes is now celebrated as palm sunday. this is imagery of it where he's coming and some people are greeting him to jerusalem as kind of a king. they're laying down these palms before his path. then, this is the famous where he goes to the main temple at jerusalem and he cleanses it of the moneychangers. he's like, ""hey, by doing these money transactions here, you are defiling the temple."" then, on thursday of that week, he has the famous last supper. some people believe this is the passover seder. most historians don't think it is. but he's meeting with his  disciples. and he's saying, ""one of you's going to betray me."" and it's judas iscariot who does. and he goes to the religious court and he says, ""hey, i have this guy who you guys don't like."" remember, this whole time that jesus is doing his ministry, he's sticking it... in a lot of ways, he's calling out these pharisees and these religious officials as hypocrites. he's getting all of these followers. a lot of these traditionalists are saying, ""this guy's blaspheming. he's saying he's the son of god. he's saying all of these things. he's doing these miracles on the sabbath, when you're not supposed to be doing anything."" and so, judas iscariot goes to the sanhedrin and says, ""hey, i have this guy. come and get him."" and they get jesus and this is the famous trial of jesus by the sanhedrin. and they say, ""hey, you've been saying all these things. we think you're blaspheming."" and jesus stays silent for the most part. so, they deem him guilty and they hand him over to the roman governor pontius pilate. and they say, ""hey, look, this guy's trying to create an insurrection against rome."" which the romans take very seriously. and, in the bible, they have him seeming somewhat reluctantly saying, ""oh, okay, do we really need to do this?"" but then he says, ""alright, if that's the way you all want it."" and so, the romans crucify jesus. and this is what is now viewed as good friday, the crucifixion of jesus. and then, on sunday, and this was predicted by jesus to his followers, he is resurrected. he leaves the tomb where he was. and this is a very important week. you have palm sunday. you have good friday. and then, you have the resurrection. and then, another very, very important event to christians is  days after the resurrection. so, after  days... over that  days after the resurrection, he's seen by his followers. he's seen by many people. he continues to preach. and then, you have the ascension where he goes to the kingdom of heaven. now, i'm gonna leave you with a quote by a famous christian historian. and it's a fascinating one. and it's very clear, because we just talked about the crucifixion and you see a cross at every church. ""christianity is the only major religion to have as its central event the humiliation of its god."" that's doctor bruce shelley. and whether you believe in christianity or you don't believe. whether you're an atheist. whether you believe in the miracles or you don't. it's worth pointing out that christianity has grown from this religion that started around this preacher in galilee and judea and now has over two billion adherents. and what was it about this religion and its central event being the humiliation of its god that made it so appealing to many, especially in that early roman empire, both to jews and to non-jews, to gentiles, and has made it such a significant religion?. the title of the content is early christianity","- [Instructor] We're now going to talk about the beginnings of one of the most important religions in human history.

He leaves the tomb where he was. And this is a very important week. You have Palm Sunday. You have Good Friday. And then, you have the resurrection.

[theme music] any understanding of christianity has to start with judaism, because jesus was born a jew, and he grew up in the jewish tradition. he was one of many teachers spreading his ideas in the roman province of judea at the time, and he was part of a messianic tradition that helps us understand why he was thought of not only teacher but something much, much more. let’s go straight to the thought bubble today. the people who would become the jews, were just one of many tribal peoples eking out an existence in that not-very fertile crescent world of mesopotamia after the agricultural revolution. the hebrews initially worshiped many gods, making sacrifices to them in order to bring good weather and good fortune. but they eventually developed a religion centered around an idea that would become key to the other great western religions. this was monotheism, the idea that there is only one true god (or at least that if there are other gods around, they are total lameoids). the hebrews developed a second concept that is key to their religion as well: the idea of the covenant, a deal with god. the main man in this, the big macher was abraham. not to make this too much of a scripture lesson, but it’s kind of hard to understand the jews without understanding abraham, or abram as he was known before he had his big conversation with god. recorded in genesis : ""when abram was ninety years and nine, the lord appeared to abram, and said unto him, 'i am the almighty god; walk before me, and be thou perfect.' "" and i’m a make a covenant with you and a bunch of cool things will happen like you’re gonna have kids and your descendants will number the stars and you can have all the land of canaan forever, it’s gonna be awesome. i’m paraphrasing by the way, thought bubble. so god promised that abram would have kids with his wife even though the dude was already like , but there was a catch: ""this is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; every man child among you shall be circumcised."" keep it pg-, thought bubble. now that is asking a lot from a guy, especially a -year-old geezer like abram living in a time before general anesthesia. but those were the terms of the deal, and in exchange god had chosen abraham and his descendants to be a great nation. from this we get the expression that the jews are the chosen people. thanks for keeping it clean, thought bubble. so, some important things about this god: one, singularity. he — and i’m using the masculine pronoun because that’s what hebrew prayers use — does not want you to put any gods before him. he is also transcendent, having always existed and he is deeply personal – he chats with prophets, sends locusts, etc. but he doesn’t take corporeal form like the greek and roman gods do. he is also involved in history, like he will destroy cities, and bring floods, and determine the outcome of wars, and possibly football games. stan, no! football games! probably most important to us today, and certainly most important to jesus, this god demands moral righteousness and social justice. so, this is the god of the hebrews, yahweh, and despite many ups and downs, the jewish people have stuck with him for- according to the hebrew calendar, at least- over  years. and he has stuck by them too, despite the jews being, on occasion, something of a disappointment to him. which leads to various miseries, and also to a tradition of prophets who speak for god and warn the people to get back on the right path lest there be more miseries. which brings us back to our friends, the romans. by the time that jesus was born, the land of the israelites had been absorbed into the roman empire as the province of judea. at the time of jesus’s birth, judea was under the control of herod the great, best known for building the massive temple in jerusalem, that the romans would later destroy. and by the time jesus died, an expanded judea was under the rule of herod antipater. also, unhelpfully, known as herod. both herods ultimately took their orders from the romans, and they both show up on the list of rulers who are oppressive to the jews, partly because there’s never that much religious freedom in an empire. unless you are, wait for it... the mongols [mongoltage] or the persians. also, they were hellenizers, bringing in greek theater and architecture, and rationalism. and in response to those hellenistic influences, there were a lot of preachers trying to get the jews to return to the traditions and the godly ways of the past, including the sadducees, and the pharisees, and the essenes, and the zealots. and one of those preachers, who didn’t fit comfortably into any of these four groups, was jesus of nazareth. jesus was a preacher who spread his message of peace, love and, above all, justice, across judea over the course of his actually average-length life for his time. he was remarkably charismatic, attracting a small but incredibly loyal group of followers, and he was said to perform miracles — although it’s worth noting that miracles weren’t terribly uncommon at the time. jesus’s message was particularly resonant to the poor and downtrodden and pretty radical in its anti-authoritarian stance. he said it was easier for a camel to get through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to get to heaven, he said the meek were blessed, that the last would be first and the first would be last — all of which was kind of threatening to the powers that be, who accordingly had him arrested, tried and then executed in the normal method of killing rebels at that time: crucifixion. also, just to put this question to bed, the romans crucified jesus, because he was a threat to their authority. later traditions saying that the jews killed jesus? very unfortunate, also, very untrue. we’re not going to discuss jesus’s divinity, because: . this isn’t a theology class, and . flame wars on the internet make me so uncomfortable that i have to turn to camera . hi there camera , i’m here to remind you that . fighting over such things, like fighting over whether the proverbial cake is a lie, rarely accomplishes anything, plus . what matters to us is the historical fact that people at the time believed that jesus was the messiah, the anointed one, the son of god. and they believed that he would return some day to redeem the world. which leads us to two questions about christianity: first, why did this small group of people believe this? and second, why and how did that belief become so widespread? so why would people believe that jesus was the messiah? first. the jews had a long tradition of believing that a savior who would come to them in a time of trouble. and judea under the rule of herod and the romans... definitely a time of trouble. and many of the prophecies about this savior point to someone whose life looks a lot like jesus's. for instance, isaiah  says the person will be misunderstood and mistreated, just like jesus was: “he was despised, and rejected by men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and as one from whom men hide their face he was despised; and we didn't respect him.” and a lot of the prophecies like daniel :, for instance, explained that when the messiah comes there will be this awesome, new, everlasting kingdom. and that had to sound pretty good to people who’d had their autonomy taken away from them. so some religious jews saw jesus in those prophecies and came to believe either during his life or shortly thereafter, that he was the messiah. most of them thought the new everlasting kingdom was right around the corner, which is probably why no one bothered to write down much about the life of jesus for several decades, by which time it was clear that we might have to wait a bit for this brilliant new everlasting kingdom. i should note, by the way, that the idea of a messiah was not unique to the jews at the time. even the romans got in on the action, for instance, the roman poet virgil wrote of a boy who: “shall free the earth from never-ceasing fear, he shall receive the life of gods, and see heroes with gods commingling.” sound familiar? but virgil was writing about emperor augustus in that poem, not jesus, which points again to the similarities between the two. both called sons of god. both sent to free the earth from never-ceasing fear. but one ruled the largest empire in the world; and the other believed that empire, and the world, needed to change dramatically. so why did the less wealthy and famous son of god become by far the more influential? well, here are three possible historical reasons: reason #: the romans continued to make things bad for the jews. in fact, things got much worse for the jews, especially after they launched a revolt between - ce, which did not go well. by the time the dust settled, the romans had destroyed the temple and expelled the jews from judea, beginning what we now know as the jewish diaspora. and without a temple or geographic unity, the jews had to solidify what it meant to be a jew and what the basic tenants of the religion were. this forced the followers of jesus to make a decision: were they going to continue to be jews following stricter laws set forth by rabbis, or were they going to be something else. the decision to open up their religion to non-jews, people who weren’t part of the covenant, is the central reason that christianity could become a world religion instead of just a sect of judaism. and it probably didn’t hurt that the main proponent of sticking with judaism was james, jesus’s brother, who was killed by the romans. reason #: is related to reason # and it’s all about a dude named saul. no, not that saul. yes, saul of tarsus, thank you. saul, having received a vision on the road to damascus, became paul and began visiting and sending letters to jesus followers throughout the mediterranean. and it was paul who emphatically declared that jesus followers did not have to be jews, that they did not have to be circumcised or keep to jewish laws or any of that stuff. this opened the floodgates for thousands of people to convert to this new religion. and the other thing to remember about paul is that he was a roman citizen, which meant that he could travel freely throughout the roman empire. this allowed him to make his case to lots of different people and facilitated the geographic spread of christianity. oh, it’s time for the open letter? alright. an open letter, to the fish. but first, lets see what’s in the secret compartment today. oh, stan. it’s my favorite album jesus christ superstar, finally available in my favorite format, the cassette. did i color-coordinate my shirt to jesus christ superstar? yes. dear ichthys, so check this out: in the first century when it was still super underground and hipster to be a christian, you were a secret symbol of christianity, used to kind of hide from the romans. ichthys, the greek word for fish, was an acronym and it was a super clever way to talk about religion without anyone knowing that you were talking about it. but you’ll never guess what happened - even in places where it’s completely fine to talk about christianity now and to use, you know, regular christian symbols, like the cross, you have had a huge resurgence thanks to the plastic automobile decal industry. i mean seriously, ichthys, i haven’t seen a comeback like this since jesus. best wishes, john green and lastly, christianity was born and flourished an empire with a common language that allowed for its spread. and crucially, it was also an empire in decline. like even by the end of the first century ce, rome was on its way down. and for the average person, and even for some elites, things weren’t as good as they had been, if fact they were getting worse so fast that you might have thought the end of the world was coming. and roman religion offered no promise of an afterlife, and a bunch of squabbling whiny gods - sorry if i offended adherents to roman religion, but seriously, they squabble. so even though early christians were persecuted by the roman empire and sometimes fed to the lions and other animals, the religion continued to grow, albeit slowly. but then as the roman decline continued, emperor constantine allowed the worship of jesus and then eventually converted to christianity himself. and then the religion really took off. i mean, rome wasn’t what it used to be, but everybody still wanted to be like the emperor. and soon enough there was a new son of god on coins. thanks for watching. see you next week. crash course is produced and directed by stan muller, our script supervisor is danica johnson. the show is written by my high school history teacher raoul meyer and myself and our graphics team is thought bubble. as only  million of you guessed last week, the phrase of the week was ""chipotle burrito""; if you want to guess at this week’s phrase of the week or suggest future ones, you can do so in comments where you can also ask questions about today’s video that will be answered, hopefully, by our team of historians. thanks for watching crash course, and as we say in my hometown, don't forget to be awesome. ow... again.. the title of the content is christianity from judaism to constantine - crash course world history","Hi there my name’s John Green; this is Crash Course World History and today we’re going to talk about Jesus. So this is a Roman coin from around the time Jesus was born in the Roman Empire, and it calls Augustus, the emperor, the son of God. So let’s just state at the outset that in 4 BCE, being the son of God, or at least being the son of a god was not such an unusual thing. But a poor Jew being the son of God — that was news. [Theme Music] Any understanding of Christianity has to start with Judaism, because Jesus was born a Jew, and he grew up in the Jewish tradition. He was one of many teachers spreading his ideas in the Roman province of Judea at the time, and he was part of a messianic tradition that helps us understand why he was thought of not only teacher but something much, much more. Let’s go straight to the Thought Bubble today. The people who would become the Jews, were just one of many tribal peoples eking out an existence in that not-very fertile crescent world of Mesopotamia after the agricultural revolution. The Hebrews initially worshiped many gods, making sacrifices to them in order to bring good weather and good fortune. But they eventually developed a religion centered around an idea that would become key to the other great western religions. This was monotheism, the idea that there is only one true god (or at least that if there are other gods around, they are total lameoids). The Hebrews developed a second concept that is key to their religion as well: the idea of the covenant, a deal with God. The main man in this, the big macher was Abraham. Not to make this too much of a scripture lesson, but it’s kind of hard to understand the Jews without understanding Abraham, or Abram as he was known before he had his big conversation with God. Recorded in Genesis 17: ""When Abram was ninety years and nine, the LORD appeared to Abram, and said unto him, 'I am the Almighty God; walk before me, and be thou perfect.' "" And I’m a make a covenant with you and a bunch of cool things will happen like you’re gonna have kids and your descendants will number the stars and you can have all the land of Canaan forever, it’s gonna be awesome. I’m paraphrasing by the way, Thought Bubble. So God promised that Abram would have kids with his wife even though the dude was already like 99, but there was a catch: ""This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; every man child among you shall be circumcised."" Keep it PG-13, Thought Bubble. Now that is asking a lot from a guy, especially a 99-year-old geezer like Abram living in a time before general anesthesia. But those were the terms of the deal, and in exchange God had chosen Abraham and his descendants to be a great nation. From this we get the expression that the Jews are the Chosen people. Thanks for keeping it clean, Thought Bubble. So, some important things about this god: One, singularity. He — and I’m using the masculine pronoun because that’s what Hebrew prayers use — does not want you to put any gods before Him. He is also transcendent, having always existed and he is deeply personal – he chats with prophets, sends locusts, etc. But he doesn’t take corporeal form like the Greek and Roman Gods do. He is also involved in history, like he will destroy cities, and bring floods, and determine the outcome of wars, and possibly football games. Stan, no! FOOTBALL games! Probably most important to us today, and certainly most important to Jesus, this god demands moral righteousness and social justice. So, this is the god of the Hebrews, Yahweh, and despite many ups and downs, the Jewish people have stuck with him for- according to the Hebrew calendar, at least- over 5700 years. And He has stuck by them too, despite the Jews being, on occasion, something of a disappointment to him. Which leads to various miseries, and also to a tradition of prophets who speak for God and warn the people to get back on the right path lest there be more miseries. Which brings us back to our friends, the Romans. By the time that Jesus was born, the land of the Israelites had been absorbed into the Roman Empire as the province of Judea. At the time of Jesus’s birth, Judea was under the control of Herod the Great, best known for building the massive temple in Jerusalem, that the Romans would later destroy. And by the time Jesus died, an expanded Judea was under the rule of Herod Antipater. Also, unhelpfully, known as Herod. Both Herods ultimately took their orders from the Romans, and they both show up on the list of rulers who are oppressive to the Jews, partly because there’s never that much religious freedom in an empire. Unless you are, wait for it... The Mongols [Mongoltage] or the Persians. Also, they were Hellenizers, bringing in Greek theater and architecture, and rationalism. And in response to those Hellenistic influences, there were a lot of preachers trying to get the Jews to return to the traditions and the godly ways of the past, including the Sadducees, and the Pharisees, and the Essenes, and the Zealots. And one of those preachers, who didn’t fit comfortably into any of these four groups, was Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus was a preacher who spread his message of peace, love and, above all, justice, across Judea over the course of his actually average-length life for his time. He was remarkably charismatic, attracting a small but incredibly loyal group of followers, and he was said to perform miracles — although it’s worth noting that miracles weren’t terribly uncommon at the time. Jesus’s message was particularly resonant to the poor and downtrodden and pretty radical in its anti-authoritarian stance. He said it was easier for a camel to get through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to get to heaven, he said the meek were blessed, that the last would be first and the first would be last — all of which was kind of threatening to the powers that be, who accordingly had him arrested, tried and then executed in the normal method of killing rebels at that time: crucifixion. Also, just to put this question to bed, the Romans crucified Jesus, because he was a threat to their authority. Later traditions saying that the Jews killed Jesus? Very unfortunate, also, very untrue. We’re not going to discuss Jesus’s divinity, because: 1. This isn’t a theology class, and 2. Flame wars on the Internet make me so uncomfortable that I have to turn to camera 2. Hi there camera 2, I’m here to remind you that 3. Fighting over such things, like fighting over whether the proverbial cake is a lie, rarely accomplishes anything, plus 4. What matters to us is the historical fact that people at the time believed that Jesus was the Messiah, the Anointed One, the son of God. And they believed that he would return some day to redeem the world. Which leads us to two questions about Christianity: First, Why did this small group of people believe this? And second, why and how did that belief become so widespread? So why would people believe that Jesus was the Messiah? First. The Jews had a long tradition of believing that a savior who would come to them in a time of trouble. And Judea under the rule of Herod and the Romans... definitely a time of trouble. And many of the prophecies about this savior point to someone whose life looks a lot like Jesus's. For instance, Isaiah 53 says the person will be misunderstood and mistreated, just like Jesus was: “He was despised, and rejected by men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and as one from whom men hide their face he was despised; and we didn't respect him.” And a lot of the prophecies like Daniel 7:14, for instance, explained that when the Messiah comes there will be this awesome, new, everlasting kingdom. And that had to sound pretty good to people who’d had their autonomy taken away from them. So some religious Jews saw Jesus in those prophecies and came to believe either during his life or shortly thereafter, that he was the messiah. Most of them thought the new everlasting kingdom was right around the corner, which is probably why no one bothered to write down much about the life of Jesus for several decades, by which time it was clear that we might have to wait a bit for this brilliant new everlasting kingdom. I should note, by the way, that the idea of a messiah was not unique to the Jews at the time. Even the Romans got in on the action, for instance, the Roman poet Virgil wrote of a boy who: “Shall free the earth from never-ceasing fear, he shall receive the life of gods, and see Heroes with gods commingling.” Sound familiar? But Virgil was writing about Emperor Augustus in that poem, not Jesus, which points again to the similarities between the two. Both called sons of God. Both sent to free the earth from never-ceasing fear. But one ruled the largest empire in the world; and the other believed that empire, and the world, needed to change dramatically. So why did the less wealthy and famous son of God become by far the more influential? Well, here are three possible historical reasons: Reason #1: The Romans continued to make things bad for the Jews. In fact, things got much worse for the Jews, especially after they launched a revolt between 66-73 CE, which did not go well. By the time the dust settled, the Romans had destroyed the Temple and expelled the Jews from Judea, beginning what we now know as the Jewish Diaspora. And without a Temple or geographic unity, the Jews had to solidify what it meant to be a Jew and what the basic tenants of the religion were. This forced the followers of Jesus to make a decision: were they going to continue to be Jews following stricter laws set forth by rabbis, or were they going to be something else. The decision to open up their religion to non-Jews, people who weren’t part of the covenant, is the central reason that Christianity could become a world religion instead of just a sect of Judaism. And it probably didn’t hurt that the main proponent of sticking with Judaism was James, Jesus’s brother, who was killed by the Romans. Reason #2: Is related to Reason #1 and it’s all about a dude named Saul. No, not that Saul. Yes, Saul of Tarsus, thank you. Saul, having received a vision on the road to Damascus, became Paul and began visiting and sending letters to Jesus followers throughout the Mediterranean. And it was Paul who emphatically declared that Jesus followers did NOT have to be Jews, that they did not have to be circumcised or keep to Jewish laws or any of that stuff. This opened the floodgates for thousands of people to convert to this new religion. And the other thing to remember about Paul is that he was a Roman citizen, which meant that he could travel freely throughout the Roman Empire. This allowed him to make his case to lots of different people and facilitated the geographic spread of Christianity. Oh, it’s time for the open letter? Alright. An open letter, to the fish. But first, lets see what’s in the secret compartment today. Oh, Stan. It’s my favorite album Jesus Christ Superstar, finally available in my favorite format, the cassette. Did I color-coordinate my shirt to Jesus Christ Superstar? Yes. Dear Ichthys, So check this out: In the first century when it was still super underground and hipster to be a Christian, you were a secret symbol of Christianity, used to kind of hide from the Romans. Ichthys, the Greek word for fish, was an acronym and it was a super clever way to talk about religion without anyone knowing that you were talking about it. But you’ll never guess what happened - even in places where it’s completely fine to talk about Christianity now and to use, you know, regular Christian symbols, like the cross, you have had a huge resurgence thanks to the plastic automobile decal industry. I mean seriously, Ichthys, I haven’t seen a comeback like this since Jesus. Best wishes, John Green And lastly, Christianity was born and flourished an empire with a common language that allowed for its spread. And crucially, it was also an Empire in decline. Like even by the end of the first century CE, Rome was on its way down. And for the average person, and even for some elites, things weren’t as good as they had been, if fact they were getting worse so fast that you might have thought the end of the world was coming. And Roman religion offered no promise of an afterlife, and a bunch of squabbling whiny gods - sorry if I offended adherents to Roman religion, but seriously, they squabble. So even though early Christians were persecuted by the Roman Empire and sometimes fed to the lions and other animals, the religion continued to grow, albeit slowly. But then as the Roman decline continued, Emperor Constantine allowed the worship of Jesus and then eventually converted to Christianity himself. And then the religion really took off. I mean, Rome wasn’t what it used to be, but everybody still wanted to be like the Emperor. And soon enough there was a new son of God on coins. Thanks for watching. See you next week.

this really angers them, and so we read from the book of acts, they all rushed at him, dragged him out of the city, and began to stone him. meanwhile, the witnesses lay their coats at the feet of a young man named saul, and we see him right over here, depicted in this painting. saul approved of their killing him. on that day, a great persecution broke out against the church in jerusalem. all except the apostles were scattered throughout judea and samaria. godly men buried stephen and mourned deeply for him. but saul began to destroy the church. going from house to house, he dragged off both men and women and put them in prison. he is a pretty fervent persecutor of christians. it goes even further. then, we read, we go on to read in the book of acts, meanwhile, saul was still breathing out murderous threats against the lord's disciples. he went to the high priest and asked him for letters to the synagogues in damascus, so that if he found any there who belonged to the way, whether men or women, he might take them as prisoners to jerusalem. as he neared damascus on his journey, so this is going to be interesting thing. he's so fervent, he goes to the high priest, and says, i wanna persecute these christians wherever they are. i wanna go to damascus, and see if i can persecute them there. as he neared damascus on his journey, suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him. he fell to the ground and heard a voice say to him, ""saul, saul, why do you persecute me?"" this is an image of that, this narrative in the bible. ""who are you, lord?"", saul asked. ""i am jesus, whom you are persecuting,"" he replied. ""now get up and go into the city,"" the city being damascus, ""and you will be told what you must do."" paul is blinded by this event. he's blind for three days. he goes to damascus, and he is healed by a follower of christ. at that moment, he completely does a . he goes from being one of the chief persecutors of the christians, to being one of the chief believers, and he starts to aggressively spread the faith. so that brings us, so let's go to this map, because what's significant about paul is peter was, you can really view him as the first head of the church, especially after jesus, but he primarily viewed it as something to spread amongst the jewish people. there are events, for example, in acts where he does realize, hey, maybe i should be, the word of jesus should go beyond the jewish people. it should go to the non-jews, who are referred to as gentiles. but paul, and you can see on the map here, he has this revelation, i guess you could say, as he's approaching damascus. he goes back to jerusalem, and he tries to convince the other followers, and you can imagine they're quite skeptical of this person who is shortly before persecuting them. but he eventually convinces them, and he goes on multiple missionary journeys, spreading the faith. his center of operations is at antioch, and he's a significant figure who helps build the church at antioch. what's interesting about the church of antioch, it ends up being a very significant church, is that at antioch, the christians, or the christian faith, is not just spread to the jewish people, they're spread to the non-jews, to the gentiles. it's actually at the church of antioch that the followers of jesus christ, according to biblical accounts, were first referred to as christians. what you see on this map, here, are the various missionary journeys that paul, who is a roman citizen, was able, or saul, depending on which name you want to use, was able to do through, especially the eastern roman empire. in that mid  here, let me, in the mid , right over here, he does a missionary journey. once again, antioch is his base, he goes to cyprus, and southern, mid, what we would call turkey today. in the early , he goes on this fairly long journey through modern day turkey, through macedonia, through greece. as he's doing this, he's spreading the word of jesus christ. he's starting to help establish churches in these significant places, philippi, thessalonica, corinth, all of these various places. you see his third journey, here, very similar in path in yellow to the second journey. he does that in the late  ce. once again, he's constantly establishing these churches. the important thing to realize about paul, it's a controversy. to what degree should the teachings of jesus be spread to the gentiles, to the non-jewish people? there are these famous debates, and paul's view is, no, we should not force the gentiles to do everything that the jews have to do, the circumcision, the jewish dietary laws. you could imagine, this doubly angers the church leaders. not only is he spreading the word of jesus, that has annoyed them to no end, but he also wants to spread it to the gentiles, but he doesn't think that the gentiles need to perform all of the things that the jewish leaders believe are dictated by the laws of moses, by the jewish faith. and circumcision is actually a major debate. circumcision, the dietary habits, et cetera, et cetera. eventually, he goes back to jerusalem to face this leadership, and now this is in the early , and they, once again, they put him on trial. as a jewish citizen, he says, hey, i have a right to see the emperor. he is taken to rome, and along the way they get caught in a storm, but eventually he makes his way to rome, where he is held prisoner. it is believed that both peter and paul were killed by nero. we talk in previous videos, the fire in  ce in rome that destroys a large chunk of the city. some people think nero actually set the fire to clear some land so that he could build his palace. he famously blames the fire on christians. there's a large purge of christians that occur after that. a lot of accounts say that peter was crucified by nero. he requests, according to these accounts, to be crucified upside down, because he doesn't deserve to get the same crucifixion as jesus, and paul, some accounts say, that he was beheaded. once again, they're dying in these christian purges that nero is performing. you can see it right over here, if those accounts are true. now it's really interesting, i already talked about paul being this missionary to the gentiles. he is the one, especially at the church of antioch, where christianity starts to really separate from judaism, starts to become a faith in it's own right. that was even further accelerated in a few years after their death, or it might have been roughly coincident with their death, depending on when their deaths were. from  to , you have the jewish rebellion, sometimes called the first roman-jewish war, and it ends with the roman empire destroying the temple at jerusalem, the center of the jewish faith. the second temple of jerusalem, the one that was rebuilt, partially, by cyrus the great. so this causes the jewish people to have to leave, and they no longer have this center of their people. you have the jewish diaspora that gets spread throughout the roman empire, and other empires, like the parthians in persia. they really, there's a famous battle in  of masada, this mountain fortress, where the romans, essentially, well, it's a mass suicide, but it's this bloody extermination of the jewish people in and around jerusalem, so they are spread. that's, obviously, a significant series of events for the jewish people, but it's also significant for christianity, because jerusalem was a center of the christian faith. now the christian followers are going to be spread around, and many of these other places that paul spread the gospel, becomes centers of christianity. now to emphasize the importance of paul to christianity, this is a listing of the books of the bible. jesus, his life and teachings, is primarily coming from the gospels, right here. most of what i told you in this video, this is excerpts from the fifth book of the new testament, acts of the apostles. then, most modern orderings of the bible, the next several, or many books, are called epistles, or letters. they're primarily the epistles of paul, letters that he wrote to his followers in different places. you can see most of these names, these are cities that you see where paul was a missionary. corinthians, corinth is right here, these are letters that paul is sending to the church there. galatians, you see galatia right over here in central modern day turkey. ephesians in ephesus, philippians in philippi, right over here, colossians in colossae, thessalonians in thessalonica, right over here. this is a major chunk of the bible that is either written by paul, or some people think it was written by paul, or is ascribed to paul. what i have here in this deeper orange, these are the books that historians think were actually written by paul. this lighter orange, there are some debate, and the yellow ones are the ones where people think it probably wasn't written by paul. as you can imagine, this is a significant chunk of the new testament that was actually written or ascribed to paul. he was really the significant missionary that created the christian faith beyond the jewish people.. the title of the content is the spread of christianity","- [Instructor] The central figure in Christianity is, clearly, Jesus, but it's important to note that he does not establish the religion all by himself. In fact, at the time if his crucifixion, and, according to Christian beliefs, resurrection and ascension, the number of followers he has numbers in the low hundreds. The actual work of spreading and creating the church falls on his disciples, and, particular, the ones that are referred to as apostles. When we looked at the Gospels, which are the life and teachings of Jesus Christ, the first four books of the New Testament, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, we talk about the 12 disciples, those primary followers of Jesus. They're often referred to as the 12 Apostles, as well, because according to Christian beliefs, between the resurrection and the ascension of Jesus, he tells the apostles, look, go spread the word. Apostle comes from Greek for the one who spreads the word. These were the first Christian missionaries. Now, first amongst these apostles is often considered Peter. This is Peter, right over here. He is mentioned in the Gospels. He is beside Jesus at the time of the Transfiguration. Amongst Roman Catholics, he is viewed as the first Pope, and he is really the head of the church of the Christian followers, and they're not even called Christians at this point, in Jerusalem, right over here. But we're gonna talk about another significant apostle, as well, in this video, and that is Paul. As we'll see, Paul is not mentioned in the first four books of the Bible, he wasn't a contemporary of Jesus, or, at least, he didn't know Jesus during his life. He did live at the same time, and you can see it on this timeline where Jesus is born slightly before the Common Era, I start at year one, because there isn't a year zero, and you can see that Peter is born, historians believe, around 1 AD, and Paul would have been born shortly after that. What's interesting about Paul is, Paul starts his life as a very conservative Pharisee. He starts his life persecuting Christian people, and then he has a fairly dramatic switch. You'll often hear Paul, or you might also hear the name Saul, or Paul of Tarsus, these are all referring to the same person. Tarsus is right over here, in modern day Southern Turkey. Paul, as I mentioned, he grows up in a conservative Jewish family, but he also has Roman citizenship. That's why he has this Roman name, Paul, and he has his Hebrew name, Saul. He's educated in Jerusalem. He doesn't enter into the story until we get to the fifth book of the New Testament, the Acts of the Apostles. The Acts of the Apostles talks a lot about Peter, how he spreads the church, how he is persecuted, how he performs various miracles, but it also is where we get introduced to Paul. When we first see him, as I mentioned, he is persecuting Christians. As this Church of Jerusalem starts to get established, Peter puts a fellow by the name of Stephen in charge of distributing alms to widows that are coming to them. Stephen, and this is a narrative that you'll hear often in the New Testament, he starts to get on the nerves of the religious establishment, the Jewish religious establishment, who think that he's a blasphemer, that his beliefs are threatening them, and so there's this famous trial, once again, with the Sanhedrin, and the trial of Stephen. Here I have an account for him, of that trial, or near the end of that trial, from the book of Acts, and during that trial Stephen goes into this long account of what the teachings of Jesus are, and how they're justified by what is mentioned in the Old Testament. He actually does a fairly long account of it. He also is fairly rebellious. He says, look, you, the establishment, what prophet have you not persecuted before? This really angers them, and so we read from the book of Acts, they all rushed at him, dragged him out of the city, and began to stone him. Meanwhile, the witnesses lay their coats at the feet of a young man named Saul, and we see him right over here, depicted in this painting. Saul approved of their killing him. On that day, a great persecution broke out against the church in Jerusalem. All except the apostles were scattered throughout Judea and Samaria. Godly men buried Stephen and mourned deeply for him. But Saul began to destroy the church. Going from house to house, he dragged off both men and women and put them in prison. He is a pretty fervent persecutor of Christians. It goes even further. Then, we read, we go on to read in the book of Acts, Meanwhile, Saul was still breathing out murderous threats against the Lord's disciples. He went to the high priest and asked him for letters to the synagogues in Damascus, so that if he found any there who belonged to the Way, whether men or women, he might take them as prisoners to Jerusalem. As he neared Damascus on his journey, so this is going to be interesting thing. He's so fervent, he goes to the high priest, and says, I wanna persecute these Christians wherever they are. I wanna go to Damascus, and see if I can persecute them there. As he neared Damascus on his journey, suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him. He fell to the ground and heard a voice say to him, ""Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?"" This is an image of that, this narrative in the Bible. ""Who are you, Lord?"", Saul asked. ""I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting,"" he replied. ""Now get up and go into the city,"" the city being Damascus, ""and you will be told what you must do."" Paul is blinded by this event. He's blind for three days. He goes to Damascus, and he is healed by a follower of Christ. At that moment, he completely does a 180. He goes from being one of the chief persecutors of the Christians, to being one of the chief believers, and he starts to aggressively spread the faith. So that brings us, so let's go to this map, because what's significant about Paul is Peter was, you can really view him as the first head of the church, especially after Jesus, but he primarily viewed it as something to spread amongst the Jewish people. There are events, for example, in Acts where he does realize, hey, maybe I should be, the word of Jesus should go beyond the Jewish people. It should go to the non-Jews, who are referred to as Gentiles. But Paul, and you can see on the map here, he has this revelation, I guess you could say, as he's approaching Damascus. He goes back to Jerusalem, and he tries to convince the other followers, and you can imagine they're quite skeptical of this person who is shortly before persecuting them. But he eventually convinces them, and he goes on multiple missionary journeys, spreading the faith. His center of operations is at Antioch, and he's a significant figure who helps build the church at Antioch. What's interesting about the Church of Antioch, it ends up being a very significant church, is that at Antioch, the Christians, or the Christian faith, is not just spread to the Jewish people, they're spread to the non-Jews, to the Gentiles. It's actually at the Church of Antioch that the followers of Jesus Christ, according to Biblical accounts, were first referred to as Christians. What you see on this map, here, are the various missionary journeys that Paul, who is a Roman citizen, was able, or Saul, depending on which name you want to use, was able to do through, especially the Eastern Roman Empire. In that mid 40s here, let me, in the mid 40s, right over here, he does a missionary journey. Once again, Antioch is his base, he goes to Cyprus, and southern, mid, what we would call Turkey today. In the early 50s, he goes on this fairly long journey through modern day Turkey, through Macedonia, through Greece. As he's doing this, he's spreading the word of Jesus Christ. He's starting to help establish churches in these significant places, Philippi, Thessalonica, Corinth, all of these various places. You see his third journey, here, very similar in path in yellow to the second journey. He does that in the late 50s CE. Once again, he's constantly establishing these churches. The important thing to realize about Paul, it's a controversy. To what degree should the teachings of Jesus be spread to the Gentiles, to the non-Jewish people? There are these famous debates, and Paul's view is, no, we should not force the Gentiles to do everything that the Jews have to do, the circumcision, the Jewish dietary laws. You could imagine, this doubly angers the church leaders. Not only is he spreading the word of Jesus, that has annoyed them to no end, but he also wants to spread it to the Gentiles, but he doesn't think that the Gentiles need to perform all of the things that the Jewish leaders believe are dictated by the laws of Moses, by the Jewish faith. And circumcision is actually a major debate. Circumcision, the dietary habits, et cetera, et cetera. Eventually, he goes back to Jerusalem to face this leadership, and now this is in the early 60s, and they, once again, they put him on trial. As a Jewish citizen, he says, hey, I have a right to see the Emperor. He is taken to Rome, and along the way they get caught in a storm, but eventually he makes his way to Rome, where he is held prisoner. It is believed that both Peter and Paul were killed by Nero. We talk in previous videos, the fire in 64 CE in Rome that destroys a large chunk of the city. Some people think Nero actually set the fire to clear some land so that he could build his palace. He famously blames the fire on Christians. There's a large purge of Christians that occur after that. A lot of accounts say that Peter was crucified by Nero. He requests, according to these accounts, to be crucified upside down, because he doesn't deserve to get the same crucifixion as Jesus, and Paul, some accounts say, that he was beheaded. Once again, they're dying in these Christian purges that Nero is performing. You can see it right over here, if those accounts are true. Now it's really interesting, I already talked about Paul being this missionary to the Gentiles. He is the one, especially at the Church of Antioch, where Christianity starts to really separate from Judaism, starts to become a faith in it's own right. That was even further accelerated in a few years after their death, or it might have been roughly coincident with their death, depending on when their deaths were. From 66 to 70, you have the Jewish rebellion, sometimes called the First Roman-Jewish War, and it ends with the Roman Empire destroying the temple at Jerusalem, the center of the Jewish faith. The second temple of Jerusalem, the one that was rebuilt, partially, by Cyrus the Great. So this causes the Jewish people to have to leave, and they no longer have this center of their people. You have the Jewish diaspora that gets spread throughout the Roman Empire, and other empires, like the Parthians in Persia. They really, there's a famous battle in 73 of Masada, this mountain fortress, where the Romans, essentially, well, it's a mass suicide, but it's this bloody extermination of the Jewish people in and around Jerusalem, so they are spread. That's, obviously, a significant series of events for the Jewish people, but it's also significant for Christianity, because Jerusalem was a center of the Christian faith. Now the Christian followers are going to be spread around, and many of these other places that Paul spread the Gospel, becomes centers of Christianity. Now to emphasize the importance of Paul to Christianity, this is a listing of the books of the Bible. Jesus, his life and teachings, is primarily coming from the Gospels, right here. Most of what I told you in this video, this is excerpts from the fifth book of the New Testament, Acts of the Apostles. Then, most modern orderings of the Bible, the next several, or many books, are called epistles, or letters. They're primarily the epistles of Paul, letters that he wrote to his followers in different places. You can see most of these names, these are cities that you see where Paul was a missionary. Corinthians, Corinth is right here, these are letters that Paul is sending to the church there. Galatians, you see Galatia right over here in central modern day Turkey. Ephesians in Ephesus, Philippians in Philippi, right over here, Colossians in Colossae, Thessalonians in Thessalonica, right over here. This is a major chunk of the Bible that is either written by Paul, or some people think it was written by Paul, or is ascribed to Paul. What I have here in this deeper orange, these are the books that historians think were actually written by Paul. This lighter orange, there are some debate, and the yellow ones are the ones where people think it probably wasn't written by Paul. As you can imagine, this is a significant chunk of the New Testament that was actually written or ascribed to Paul. He was really the significant missionary that created the Christian faith beyond the Jewish people.",Early Christianity,Khan Academy (English - US curriculum) >> Arts and humanities >> World history >> 600 BCE - 600 CE Second-Wave Civilizations >> Early Christianity,"christianity starts as a jewish sect on the periphery of the roman empire. despite being actively persecuted, the religion grows through the empire, eventually becoming the official state religion.. this is the topic tree khan academy (english - us curriculum) >> arts and humanities >> world history >>  bce -  ce second-wave civilizations >> early christianity",video

for centuries, humankind has sought to understand and explain the “meaning of life.” many philosophers believe this contemplation and the desire to understand our place in the universe are what differentiate humankind from other species. religion, in one form or another, has been found in all human societies since human societies first appeared. archaeological digs have revealed ritual objects, ceremonial burial sites, and other religious artifacts. social conflict and even wars often result from religious disputes. to understand a culture, sociologists must study its religion. what is religion? pioneer sociologist émile durkheim described it with the ethereal statement that it consists of “things that surpass the limits of our knowledge” (). he went on to elaborate: religion is “a unified system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things, that is to say set apart and forbidden, beliefs and practices which unite into one single moral community, called a church, all those who adhere to them” (). some people associate religion with places of worship (a synagogue or church), others with a practice (confession or meditation), and still others with a concept that    chapter  | religion  guides their daily lives (like dharma or sin). all these people can agree that religion is a system of beliefs, values, and practices concerning what a person holds sacred or considers to be spiritually significant. does religion bring fear, wonder, relief, explanation of the unknown or control over freedom and choice? how do our religious perspectives affect our behavior? these are questions sociologists ask and are reasons they study religion. what are peoples' conceptions of the profane and the sacred? how do religious ideas affect the real-world reactions and choices of people in a society? religion can also serve as a filter for examining other issues in society and other components of a culture. for example, after the terrorist attacks of september , , it became important for teachers, church leaders, and the media to educate americans about islam to prevent stereotyping and to promote religious tolerance. sociological tools and methods, such as surveys, polls, interviews, and analysis of historical data, can be applied to the study of religion in a culture to help us better understand the role religion plays in people’s lives and the way it influences society.  . the sociological approach to religion from the latin religio (respect for what is sacred) and religare (to bind, in the sense of an obligation), the term religion describes various systems of belief and practice that define what people consider to be sacred or spiritual (fasching and dechant ; durkheim ). throughout history, and in societies across the world, leaders have used religious narratives, symbols, and traditions in an attempt to give more meaning to life and understand the universe. some form of religion is found in every known culture, and it is usually practiced in a public way by a group. the practice of religion can include feasts and festivals, intercession with god or gods, marriage and funeral services, music and art, meditation or initiation, sacrifice or service, and other aspects of culture. while some people think of religion as something individual because religious beliefs can be highly personal, religion is also a social institution. social scientists recognize that religion exists as an organized and integrated set of beliefs, behaviors, and norms centered on basic social needs and values. moreover, religion is a cultural universal found in all social groups. for instance, in every culture, funeral rites are practiced in some way, although these customs vary between cultures and within religious affiliations. despite differences, there are common elements in a ceremony marking a person’s death, such as announcement of the death, care of the deceased, disposition, and ceremony or ritual. these universals, and the differences in the way societies and individuals experience religion, provide rich material for sociological study. in studying religion, sociologists distinguish between what they term the experience, beliefs, and rituals of a religion. religious experience refers to the conviction or sensation that we are connected to “the divine.” this type of communion might be experienced when people are pray or meditate. religious beliefs are specific ideas members of a particular faith hold to be true, such as that jesus christ was the son of god, or that reincarnation exists. another illustration of religious beliefs is the creation stories we find in different religions. religious rituals are behaviors or practices that are either required or expected of the members of a particular group, such as bar mitzvah or confession of sins (barkan and greenwood ).  the history of religion as a sociological concept in the wake of nineteenth century european industrialization and secularization, three social theorists attempted to examine the relationship between religion and society: émile durkheim, max weber, and karl marx. they are among the founding thinkers of modern sociology. as stated earlier, french sociologist émile durkheim (–) defined religion as a “unified system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things” (). to him, sacred meant extraordinary—something that inspired wonder and that seemed connected to the concept of “the divine.” durkheim argued that “religion happens” in society when there is a separation between the profane (ordinary life) and the sacred (). a rock, for example, isn’t sacred or profane as it exists. but if someone makes it into a headstone, or another person uses it for landscaping, it takes on different meanings—one sacred, one profane. durkheim is generally considered the first sociologist who analyzed religion in terms of its societal impact. above all, he believed religion is about community: it binds people together (social cohesion), promotes behavior consistency (social control), and offers strength during life’s transitions and tragedies (meaning and purpose). by applying the methods of natural science to the study of society, durkheim held that the source of religion and morality is the collective mind-set of society and that the cohesive bonds of social order result from common values in a society. he contended that these values need to be maintained to maintain social stability.  this openstax book is available for free at   chapter  | religion    but what would happen if religion were to decline? this question led durkheim to posit that religion is not just a social creation but something that represents the power of society: when people celebrate sacred things, they celebrate the power of their society. by this reasoning, even if traditional religion disappeared, society wouldn’t necessarily dissolve. whereas durkheim saw religion as a source of social stability, german sociologist and political economist max weber (–) believed it was a precipitator of social change. he examined the effects of religion on economic activities and noticed that heavily protestant societies—such as those in the netherlands, england, scotland, and germany—were the most highly developed capitalist societies and that their most successful business leaders were protestant. in his writing the protestant ethic and the spirit of capitalism (), he contends that the protestant work ethic influenced the development of capitalism. weber noted that certain kinds of protestantism supported the pursuit of material gain by motivating believers to work hard, be successful, and not spend their profits on frivolous things. (the modern use of “work ethic” comes directly from weber’s protestant ethic, although it has now lost its religious connotations.)  making connections:  the  big picture  the protestant work ethic in the information age max weber () posited that, in europe in his time, protestants were more likely than catholics to value capitalist ideology, and believed in hard work and savings. he showed that protestant values directly influenced the rise of capitalism and helped create the modern world order. weber thought the emphasis on community in catholicism versus the emphasis on individual achievement in protestantism made a difference. his century-old claim that the protestant work ethic led to the development of capitalism has been one of the most important and controversial topics in the sociology of religion. in fact, scholars have found little merit to his contention when applied to modern society (greeley ). what does the concept of work ethic mean today? the work ethic in the information age has been affected by tremendous cultural and social change, just as workers in the mid- to late nineteenth century were influenced by the wake of the industrial revolution. factory jobs tend to be simple, uninvolved, and require very little thinking or decision making on the part of the worker. today, the work ethic of the modern workforce has been transformed, as more thinking and decision making is required. employees also seek autonomy and fulfillment in their jobs, not just wages. higher levels of education have become necessary, as well as people management skills and access to the most recent information on any given topic. the information age has increased the rapid pace of production expected in many jobs. on the other hand, the “mcdonaldization” of the united states (hightower ; ritzer ), in which many service industries, such as the fast-food industry, have established routinized roles and tasks, has resulted in a “discouragement” of the work ethic. in jobs where roles and tasks are highly prescribed, workers have no opportunity to make decisions. they are considered replaceable commodities as opposed to valued employees. during times of recession, these service jobs may be the only employment possible for younger individuals or those with low-level skills. the pay, working conditions, and robotic nature of the tasks dehumanizes the workers and strips them of incentives for doing quality work. working hard also doesn’t seem to have any relationship with catholic or protestant religious beliefs anymore, or those of other religions; information age workers expect talent and hard work to be rewarded by material gain and career advancement. german philosopher, journalist, and revolutionary socialist karl marx (–) also studied the social impact of religion. he believed religion reflects the social stratification of society and that it maintains inequality and perpetuates the status quo. for him, religion was just an extension of working-class (proletariat) economic suffering. he famously argued that religion “is the opium of the people” (). for durkheim, weber, and marx, who were reacting to the great social and economic upheaval of the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century in europe, religion was an integral part of society. for durkheim, religion was a force for cohesion that helped bind the members of society to the group, while weber believed religion could be understood as something separate from society. marx considered religion inseparable from the economy and the worker. religion could not be understood apart from the capitalist society that perpetuated inequality. despite their different views, these social theorists all believed in the centrality of religion to society.    chapter  | religion  theoretical perspectives on religion  figure . functionalists believe religion meets many important needs for people, including group cohesion and companionship. (photo courtesy of james emery/flickr)  modern-day sociologists often apply one of three major theoretical perspectives. these views offer different lenses through which to study and understand society: functionalism, symbolic interactionism, and conflict theory. let’s explore how scholars applying these paradigms understand religion. functionalism functionalists contend that religion serves several functions in society. religion, in fact, depends on society for its existence, value, and significance, and vice versa. from this perspective, religion serves several purposes, like providing answers to spiritual mysteries, offering emotional comfort, and creating a place for social interaction and social control. in providing answers, religion defines the spiritual world and spiritual forces, including divine beings. for example, it helps answer questions like, “how was the world created?” “why do we suffer?” “is there a plan for our lives?” and “is there an afterlife?” as another function, religion provides emotional comfort in times of crisis. religious rituals bring order, comfort, and organization through shared familiar symbols and patterns of behavior. one of the most important functions of religion, from a functionalist perspective, is the opportunities it creates for social interaction and the formation of groups. it provides social support and social networking and offers a place to meet others who hold similar values and a place to seek help (spiritual and material) in times of need. moreover, it can foster group cohesion and integration. because religion can be central to many people’s concept of themselves, sometimes there is an “in-group” versus “out-group” feeling toward other religions in our society or within a particular practice. on an extreme level, the inquisition, the salem witch trials, and anti-semitism are all examples of this dynamic. finally, religion promotes social control: it reinforces social norms such as appropriate styles of dress, following the law, and regulating sexual behavior. conflict theory conflict theorists view religion as an institution that helps maintain patterns of social inequality. for example, the vatican has a tremendous amount of wealth, while the average income of catholic parishioners is small. according to this perspective, religion has been used to support the “divine right” of oppressive monarchs and to justify unequal social structures, like india’s caste system. conflict theorists are critical of the way many religions promote the idea that believers should be satisfied with existing circumstances because they are divinely ordained. this power dynamic has been used by christian institutions for centuries to keep poor people poor and to teach them that they shouldn’t be concerned with what they lack because their “true” reward (from a religious perspective) will come after death. conflict theorists also point out that those in power in a religion are often able to dictate practices, rituals, and beliefs through their interpretation of religious texts or via proclaimed direct communication from the divine.  this openstax book is available for free at   chapter  | religion    figure . many religions, including the catholic faith, have long prohibited women from becoming spiritual leaders. feminist theorists focus on gender inequality and promote leadership roles for women in religion. (photo courtesy of wikimedia commons)  the feminist perspective is a conflict theory view that focuses specifically on gender inequality. in terms of religion, feminist theorists assert that, although women are typically the ones to socialize children into a religion, they have traditionally held very few positions of power within religions. a few religions and religious denominations are more gender equal, but male dominance remains the norm of most.  making connections:  sociology  in the  real world  rational choice theory: can economic theory be applied to religion? how do people decide which religion to follow, if any? how does one pick a church or decide which denomination “fits” best? rational choice theory (rct) is one way social scientists have attempted to explain these behaviors. the theory proposes that people are self-interested, though not necessarily selfish, and that people make rational choices—choices that can reasonably be expected to maximize positive outcomes while minimizing negative outcomes. sociologists roger finke and rodney stark () first considered the use of rct to explain some aspects of religious behavior, with the assumption that there is a basic human need for religion in terms of providing belief in a supernatural being, a sense of meaning in life, and belief in life after death. religious explanations of these concepts are presumed to be more satisfactory than scientific explanations, which may help to account for the continuation of strong religious connectedness in countries such as the united states, despite predictions of some competing theories for a great decline in religious affiliation due to modernization and religious pluralism. another assumption of rct is that religious organizations can be viewed in terms of “costs” and “rewards.” costs are not only monetary requirements, but are also the time, effort, and commitment demands of any particular religious organization. rewards are the intangible benefits in terms of belief and satisfactory explanations about life, death, and the supernatural, as well as social rewards from membership. rct proposes that, in a pluralistic society with many religious options, religious organizations will compete for members, and people will choose between different churches or denominations in much the same way they select other consumer goods, balancing costs and rewards in a rational manner. in this framework, rct also explains the development and decline of churches, denominations, sects, and even cults; this limited part of the very complex rct theory is the only aspect well supported by research data. critics of rct argue that it doesn’t fit well with human spiritual needs, and many sociologists disagree that the costs and rewards of religion can even be meaningfully measured or that individuals use a rational balancing process regarding religious affiliation. the theory doesn’t address many aspects of religion that individuals may consider essential (such as faith) and further fails to account for agnostics and atheists who don’t seem to have a similar need for religious explanations. critics also believe this theory overuses economic terminology and structure and point out that terms such as “rational” and “reward” are unacceptably defined by their use; they would argue that the theory is based on faulty logic and lacks external, empirical support. a scientific explanation for why something occurs can’t reasonably be supported by the fact that it does occur. rct is widely used in economics and to a lesser extent in criminal justice, but the application of rct in explaining the religious beliefs and behaviors of people and societies is still being debated in sociology today.    chapter  | religion  symbolic interactionism rising from the concept that our world is socially constructed, symbolic interactionism studies the symbols and interactions of everyday life. to interactionists, beliefs and experiences are not sacred unless individuals in a society regard them as sacred. the star of david in judaism, the cross in christianity, and the crescent and star in islam are examples of sacred symbols. interactionists are interested in what these symbols communicate. because interactionists study one-on-one, everyday interactions between individuals, a scholar using this approach might ask questions focused on this dynamic. the interaction between religious leaders and practitioners, the role of religion in the ordinary components of everyday life, and the ways people express religious values in social interactions—all might be topics of study to an interactionist.  . world religions  figure . the symbols of fourteen religions are depicted here. in no particular order, they represent judaism, wicca, taoism, christianity, confucianism, baha’i, druidism, islam, hinduism, zoroastrianism, shinto, jainism, sikhism, and buddhism. can you match the symbol to the religion? what might a symbolic interactionist make of these symbols? (photo courtesy of religioustolerance.org ( )  the major religions of the world (hinduism, buddhism, islam, confucianism, christianity, taoism, and judaism) differ in many respects, including how each religion is organized and the belief system each upholds. other differences include the nature of belief in a higher power, the history of how the world and the religion began, and the use of sacred texts and objects.  types of religious organizations religions organize themselves—their institutions, practitioners, and structures—in a variety of fashions. for instance, when the roman catholic church emerged, it borrowed many of its organizational principles from the ancient roman military and turned senators into cardinals, for example. sociologists use different terms, like ecclesia, denomination, and sect, to define these types of organizations. scholars are also aware that these definitions are not static. most religions transition through different organizational phases. for example, christianity began as a cult, transformed into a sect, and today exists as an ecclesia. cults, like sects, are new religious groups. in the united states today this term often carries pejorative connotations. however, almost all religions began as cults and gradually progressed to levels of greater size and organization. the term cult is sometimes used interchangeably with the term new religious movement (nrm). in its pejorative use, these groups are often disparaged as being secretive, highly controlling of members’ lives, and dominated by a single, charismatic leader. controversy exists over whether some groups are cults, perhaps due in part to media sensationalism over groups like polygamous mormons or the peoples temple followers who died at jonestown, guyana. some groups that are controversially labeled as cults today include the church of scientology and the hare krishna movement. a sect is a small and relatively new group. most of the well-known christian denominations in the united states today began as sects. for example, the methodists and baptists protested against their parent anglican church in england, just as henry viii protested against the catholic church by forming the anglican church. from “protest” comes the term protestant.  this openstax book is available for free at   chapter  | religion    occasionally, a sect is a breakaway group that may be in tension with larger society. they sometimes claim to be returning to “the fundamentals” or to contest the veracity of a particular doctrine. when membership in a sect increases over time, it may grow into a denomination. often a sect begins as an offshoot of a denomination, when a group of members believes they should separate from the larger group. some sects dissolve without growing into denominations. sociologists call these established sects. established sects, such as the amish or jehovah’s witnesses fall halfway between sect and denomination on the ecclesia–cult continuum because they have a mixture of sect-like and denomination-like characteristics. a denomination is a large, mainstream religious organization, but it does not claim to be official or state sponsored. it is one religion among many. for example, baptist, african methodist episcopal, catholic, and seventh-day adventist are all christian denominations. the term ecclesia, originally referring to a political assembly of citizens in ancient athens, greece, now refers to a congregation. in sociology, the term is used to refer to a religious group that most all members of a society belong to. it is considered a nationally recognized, or official, religion that holds a religious monopoly and is closely allied with state and secular powers. the united states does not have an ecclesia by this standard; in fact, this is the type of religious organization that many of the first colonists came to america to escape.  figure . how might you classify the mennonites? as a cult, a sect, or a denomination? (photo courtesy of frenkieb/flickr) one way to remember these religious organizational terms is to think of cults, sects, denominations, and ecclesia representing a continuum, with increasing influence on society, where cults are least influential and ecclesia are most influential.  types of religions scholars from a variety of disciplines have strived to classify religions. one widely accepted categorization that helps people understand different belief systems considers what or who people worship (if anything). using this method of classification, religions might fall into one of these basic categories, as shown in table ..    chapter  | religion  table . one way scholars have categorized religions is by classifying what or who they hold to be divine. religious classification  what/who is divine  example  polytheism  multiple gods  belief systems of the ancient greeks and romans  monotheism  single god  judaism, islam  atheism  no deities  atheism  animism  nonhuman beings (animals, plants, natural world)  indigenous nature worship (shinto)  totemism  human-natural being connection  ojibwa (native american) beliefs  note that some religions may be practiced—or understood—in various categories. for instance, the christian notion of the holy trinity (god, jesus, holy spirit) defies the definition of monotheism, which is a religion based on belief in a single deity, to some scholars. similarly, many westerners view the multiple manifestations of hinduism’s godhead as polytheistic, which is a religion based on belief in multiple deities,, while hindus might describe those manifestations are a monotheistic parallel to the christian trinity. some japanese practice shinto, which follows animism, which is a religion that believes in the divinity of nonhuman beings, like animals, plants, and objects of the natural world, while people who practice totemism believe in a divine connection between humans and other natural beings. it is also important to note that every society also has nonbelievers, such as atheists, who do not believe in a divine being or entity, and agnostics, who hold that ultimate reality (such as god) is unknowable. while typically not an organized group, atheists and agnostics represent a significant portion of the population. it is important to recognize that being a nonbeliever in a divine entity does not mean the individual subscribes to no morality. indeed, many nobel peace prize winners and other great humanitarians over the centuries would have classified themselves as atheists or agnostics.  the world’s religions religions have emerged and developed across the world. some have been short-lived, while others have persisted and grown. in this section, we will explore seven of the world’s major religions. hinduism the oldest religion in the world, hinduism originated in the indus river valley about , years ago in what is now modern-day northwest india and pakistan. it arose contemporaneously with ancient egyptian and mesopotamian cultures. with roughly one billion followers, hinduism is the third-largest of the world’s religions. hindus believe in a divine power that can manifest as different entities. three main incarnations—brahma, vishnu, and shiva—are sometimes compared to the manifestations of the divine in the christian trinity. multiple sacred texts, collectively called the vedas, contain hymns and rituals from ancient india and are mostly written in sanskrit. hindus generally believe in a set of principles called dharma, which refer to one’s duty in the world that corresponds with “right” actions. hindus also believe in karma, or the notion that spiritual ramifications of one’s actions are balanced cyclically in this life or a future life (reincarnation).  figure . hindu women sometimes apply decorations of henna dye to their hands for special occasions such as weddings and religious festivals.

(photo courtesy of nancy pelosi/flickr)  buddhism buddhism was founded by siddhartha gautama around  b.c.e. siddhartha was said to have given up a comfortable, upper-class life to follow one of poverty and spiritual devotion. at the age of thirty-five, he famously meditated under a sacred fig tree and vowed not to rise before he achieved enlightenment (bodhi). after this experience, he became known as buddha, or “enlightened one.” followers were drawn to buddha’s teachings and the practice of meditation, and he later established a monastic order.  figure . meditation is an important practice in buddhism. a tibetan monk is shown here engaged in solitary meditation. (photo courtesy of prince roy/flickr)  buddha’s teachings encourage buddhists to lead a moral life by accepting the four noble truths: ) life is suffering, ) suffering arises from attachment to desires, ) suffering ceases when attachment to desires ceases, and ) freedom from suffering is possible by following the “middle way.” the concept of the “middle way” is central to buddhist thinking, which encourages people to live in the present and to practice acceptance of others (smith ). buddhism also tends to deemphasize the role of a godhead, instead stressing the importance of personal responsibility (craig ). confucianism confucianism was the official religion of china from  b.c.e. until it was officially abolished when communist leadership discouraged religious practice in . the religion was developed by kung fu-tzu (confucius), who lived in the sixth and fifth centuries b.c.e. an extraordinary teacher, his lessons—which were about self-discipline, respect for authority and tradition, and jen (the kind treatment of every person)—were collected in a book called the analects. some religious scholars consider confucianism more of a social system than a religion because it focuses on sharing wisdom about moral practices but doesn’t involve any type of specific worship; nor does it have formal objects. in fact, its teachings were developed in context of problems of social anarchy and a near-complete deterioration of social cohesion.    chapter  | religion  dissatisfied with the social solutions put forth, kung fu-tzu developed his own model of religious morality to help guide society (smith ). taoism in taoism, the purpose of life is inner peace and harmony. tao is usually translated as “way” or “path.” the founder of the religion is generally recognized to be a man named laozi, who lived sometime in the sixth century b.c.e. in china. taoist beliefs emphasize the virtues of compassion and moderation. the central concept of tao can be understood to describe a spiritual reality, the order of the universe, or the way of modern life in harmony with the former two. the ying-yang symbol and the concept of polar forces are central taoist ideas (smith ). some scholars have compared this chinese tradition to its confucian counterpart by saying that “whereas confucianism is concerned with day-to-day rules of conduct, taoism is concerned with a more spiritual level of being” (feng and english ). judaism after their exodus from egypt in the thirteenth century b.c.e., jews, a nomadic society, became monotheistic, worshipping only one god. the jews’ covenant, or promise of a special relationship with yahweh (god), is an important element of judaism, and their sacred text is the torah, which christians also follow as the first five books of the bible. talmud refers to a collection of sacred jewish oral interpretation of the torah. jews emphasize moral behavior and action in this world as opposed to beliefs or personal salvation in the next world.  figure . the islamic house of worship is called a mosque. (photo courtesy of david stanley/flickr) islam islam is monotheistic religion and it follows the teaching of the prophet muhammad, born in mecca, saudi arabia, in  c.e. muhammad is seen only as a prophet, not as a divine being, and he is believed to be the messenger of allah (god), who is divine. the followers of islam, whose u.s. population is projected to double in the next twenty years (pew research forum ), are called muslims. islam means “peace” and “submission.” the sacred text for muslims is the qur’an (or koran). as with christianity’s old testament, many of the qur’an stories are shared with the jewish faith. divisions exist within islam, but all muslims are guided by five beliefs or practices, often called “pillars”: ) allah is the only god, and muhammad is his prophet, ) daily prayer, ) helping those in poverty, ) fasting as a spiritual practice, and ) pilgrimage to the holy center of mecca.  this openstax book is available for free at   chapter  | religion    figure . cornerstones of muslim practice is journeying to the religion’s most sacred place, mecca. (photo courtesy of raeky/flickr) christianity today the largest religion in the world, christianity began , years ago in palestine, with jesus of nazareth, a charismatic leader who taught his followers about caritas (charity) or treating others as you would like to be treated yourself. the sacred text for christians is the bible. while jews, christians, and muslims share many of same historical religious stories, their beliefs verge. in their shared sacred stories, it is suggested that the son of god—a messiah—will return to save god’s followers. while christians believe that he already appeared in the person of jesus christ, jews and muslims disagree. while they recognize christ as an important historical figure, their traditions don’t believe he’s the son of god, and their faiths see the prophecy of the messiah’s arrival as not yet fulfilled. different christian groups have variations among their sacred texts. for instance, mormons, an established christian sect, also use the book of mormon, which they believe details other parts of christian doctrine and jesus’ life that aren’t included in the bible. similarly, the catholic bible includes the apocrypha, a collection that, while part of the  king james translation, is no longer included in protestant versions of the bible. although monotheistic, christians often describe their god through three manifestations that they call the holy trinity: the father (god), the son (jesus), and the holy spirit. the holy spirit is a term christians often use to describe religious experience, or how they feel the presence of the sacred in their lives. one foundation of christian doctrine is the ten commandments, which decry acts considered sinful, including theft, murder, and adultery.  . religion in the united states in examining the state of religion in the united states today, we see the complexity of religious life in our society, plus emerging trends like the rise of the megachurch, secularization, and the role of religion in social change.  religion and social change religion has historically been an impetus to social change. the translation of sacred texts into everyday, nonscholarly language empowered people to shape their religions. disagreements between religious groups and instances of religious persecution have led to wars and genocides. the united states is no stranger to religion as an agent of social change. in fact, the united states' first european arrivals were acting largely on religious convictions when they were compelled to settle in the united states.  liberation theology liberation theology began as a movement within the roman catholic church in the  and  in latin america, and it combines christian principles with political activism. it uses the church to promote social change via the political arena, and it is most often seen in attempts to reduce or eliminate social injustice, discrimination, and poverty. a list of proponents of this kind of social justice (although some pre-date liberation theory) could include francis of assisi, leo tolstoy, martin luther king jr., and desmond tutu. although begun as a moral reaction against the poverty caused by social injustice in that part of the world, today liberation theology is an international movement that encompasses many churches and denominations. liberation theologians discuss theology from the point of view of the poor and the oppressed, and some interpret the scriptures as a call to action against poverty and injustice. in europe and north america, feminist theology has emerged from liberation theology as a movement to bring social justice to women.    making connections:  chapter  | religion  social policy  & debate  religious leaders and the rainbow of gay pride what happens when a religious leader officiates a gay marriage against denomination policies? what about when that same minister defends the action in part by coming out and making her own lesbian relationship known to the church? in the case of the reverend amy delong, it meant a church trial. some leaders in her denomination assert that homosexuality is incompatible with their faith, while others feel this type of discrimination has no place in a modern church (barrick ). as the lbgt community increasingly advocates for, and earns, basic civil rights, how will religious communities respond? many religious groups have traditionally discounted lbgt sexualities as “wrong.” however, these organizations have moved closer to respecting human rights by, for example, increasingly recognizing females as an equal gender. the roman catholic church drew controversial attention to this issue in  when the vatican secretary of state suggested homosexuality was in part to blame for pedophilic sexual abuse scandals that have plagued the church (beck ). because numerous studies have shown there to be no relationship between homosexuality and pedophilia, nor a higher incidence of pedophilia among homosexuals than among heterosexuals (beck ), the vatican’s comments seem suspect. more recently pope francis has been pushing for a more open church, and some catholic bishops have been advocating for a more ""gay-friendly"" church (mckenna, ). this has not come to pass, but some scholars believe these changes are a matter of time. no matter the situation, most religions have a tenuous (at best) relationship with practitioners and leaders in the gay community. as one of the earliest christian denominations to break barriers by ordaining women to serve as pastors, will amy delong’s united methodist denomination also be a leader in lbgt rights within christian churchgoing society?  megachurches a megachurch is a christian church that has a very large congregation averaging more than , people who attend regular weekly services. as of , the largest megachurch in the united states was in houston texas, boasting an average weekly attendance of more than , (bogan ). megachurches exist in other parts of the world, especially in south korea, brazil, and several african countries, but the rise of the megachurch in the united states is a fairly recent phenomenon that has developed primarily in california, florida, georgia, and texas. since  the number of megachurches in this country has grown from about fifty to more than ,, most of which are attached to the southern baptist denomination (bogan ). approximately six million people are members of these churches (bird and thumma ). the architecture of these church buildings often resembles a sport or concert arena. the church may include jumbotrons (large-screen televisual technology usually used in sports arenas to show close-up shots of an event). worship services feature contemporary music with drums and electric guitars and use state-of-the-art sound equipment. the buildings sometimes include food courts, sports and recreation facilities, and bookstores. services such as child care and mental health counseling are often offered. typically, a single, highly charismatic pastor leads the megachurch; at present, most are male. some megachurches and their preachers have a huge television presence, and viewers all around the country watch and respond to their shows and fundraising. besides size, u.s. megachurches share other traits, including conservative theology, evangelism, use of technology and social networking (facebook, twitter, podcasts, blogs), hugely charismatic leaders, few financial struggles, multiple sites, and predominantly white membership. they list their main focuses as youth activities, community service, and study of the scripture (hartford institute for religion research b). critics of megachurches believe they are too large to promote close relationships among fellow church members or the pastor, as could occur in smaller houses of worship. supporters note that, in addition to the large worship services, congregations generally meet in small groups, and some megachurches have informal events throughout the week to allow for community-building (hartford institute for religion research a).  this openstax book is available for free at   chapter  | religion    secularization historical sociologists émile durkheim, max weber, and karl marx and psychoanalyst sigmund freud anticipated secularization and claimed that the modernization of society would bring about a decrease in the influence of religion. weber believed membership in distinguished clubs would outpace membership in protestant sects as a way for people to gain authority or respect. conversely, some people suggest secularization is a root cause of many social problems, such as divorce, drug use, and educational downturn. one-time presidential contender michele bachmann even linked hurricane irene and the  earthquake felt in washington d.c. to politicians’ failure to listen to god (ward ). while some scholars see the united states becoming increasingly secular, others observe a rise in fundamentalism. compared to other democratic, industrialized countries, the united states is generally perceived to be a fairly religious nation. whereas  percent of u.s. adults in a  gallup survey said religion was an important part of their daily lives, the numbers were lower in spain ( percent), canada ( percent), france ( percent), the united kingdom ( percent), and sweden ( percent) (crabtree and pelham ). secularization interests social observers because it entails a pattern of change in a fundamental social institution.  making connections:  sociology  in the  real world  thank god for that touchdown: separation of church and state imagine three public universities with football games scheduled on saturday. at university a, a group of students in the stands who share the same faith decide to form a circle amid the spectators to pray for the team. for fifteen minutes, people in the circle share their prayers aloud among their group. at university b, the team ahead at halftime decides to join together in prayer, giving thanks and seeking support from god. this lasts for the first ten minutes of halftime on the sidelines of the field while spectators watch. at university c, the game program includes, among its opening moments, two minutes set aside for the team captain to share a prayer of his choosing with the spectators. in the tricky area of separation of church and state, which of these actions is allowed and which is forbidden? in our three fictional scenarios, the last example is against the law while the first two situations are perfectly acceptable. in the united states, a nation founded on the principles of religious freedom (many settlers were escaping religious persecution in europe), how stringently do we adhere to this ideal? how well do we respect people’s right to practice any belief system of their choosing? the answer just might depend on what religion you practice. in , for example, a lawsuit escalated in alabama regarding a monument to the ten commandments in a public building. in response, a poll was conducted by usa today, cnn, and gallup. among the findings:  percent of people approved of a christian ten commandments monument in public, while only  percent approved of a monument to the islamic qur’an in the same space. similarly, survey respondents showed a  percent approval of social programs run by christian organizations, but only  percent approved of the same programs run by muslim groups (newport ). these statistics suggest that, for most people in the united states, freedom of religion is less important than the religion under discussion. and this is precisely the point made by those who argue for separation of church and state. according to their contention, any state-sanctioned recognition of religion suggests endorsement of one belief system at the expense of all others—contradictory to the idea of freedom of religion. so what violates separation of church and state and what is acceptable?

Introduction to Religion
Why do sociologists study religion? For centuries, humankind has sought to understand and explain the “meaning of life.”
Many philosophers believe this contemplation and the desire to understand our place in the universe are what differentiate
humankind from other species. Religion, in one form or another, has been found in all human societies since human
societies first appeared. Archaeological digs have revealed ritual objects, ceremonial burial sites, and other religious
artifacts. Social conflict and even wars often result from religious disputes. To understand a culture, sociologists must
study its religion.
What is religion? Pioneer sociologist Émile Durkheim described it with the ethereal statement that it consists of “things
that surpass the limits of our knowledge” (1915). He went on to elaborate: Religion is “a unified system of beliefs and
practices relative to sacred things, that is to say set apart and forbidden, beliefs and practices which unite into one single
moral community, called a church, all those who adhere to them” (1915). Some people associate religion with places of
worship (a synagogue or church), others with a practice (confession or meditation), and still others with a concept that

334

Chapter 15 | Religion

guides their daily lives (like dharma or sin). All these people can agree that religion is a system of beliefs, values, and
practices concerning what a person holds sacred or considers to be spiritually significant.
Does religion bring fear, wonder, relief, explanation of the unknown or control over freedom and choice? How do our
religious perspectives affect our behavior? These are questions sociologists ask and are reasons they study religion. What
are peoples' conceptions of the profane and the sacred? How do religious ideas affect the real-world reactions and choices
of people in a society?
Religion can also serve as a filter for examining other issues in society and other components of a culture. For example,
after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, it became important for teachers, church leaders, and the media to educate
Americans about Islam to prevent stereotyping and to promote religious tolerance. Sociological tools and methods, such as
surveys, polls, interviews, and analysis of historical data, can be applied to the study of religion in a culture to help us
better understand the role religion plays in people’s lives and the way it influences society.

15.1 The Sociological Approach to Religion
From the Latin religio (respect for what is sacred) and religare (to bind, in the sense of an obligation), the term religion
describes various systems of belief and practice that define what people consider to be sacred or spiritual (Fasching and
deChant 2001; Durkheim 1915). Throughout history, and in societies across the world, leaders have used religious
narratives, symbols, and traditions in an attempt to give more meaning to life and understand the universe. Some form of
religion is found in every known culture, and it is usually practiced in a public way by a group. The practice of religion
can include feasts and festivals, intercession with God or gods, marriage and funeral services, music and art, meditation or
initiation, sacrifice or service, and other aspects of culture.
While some people think of religion as something individual because religious beliefs can be highly personal, religion is
also a social institution. Social scientists recognize that religion exists as an organized and integrated set of beliefs,
behaviors, and norms centered on basic social needs and values. Moreover, religion is a cultural universal found in all
social groups. For instance, in every culture, funeral rites are practiced in some way, although these customs vary between
cultures and within religious affiliations. Despite differences, there are common elements in a ceremony marking a
person’s death, such as announcement of the death, care of the deceased, disposition, and ceremony or ritual. These
universals, and the differences in the way societies and individuals experience religion, provide rich material for
sociological study.
In studying religion, sociologists distinguish between what they term the experience, beliefs, and rituals of a religion.
Religious experience refers to the conviction or sensation that we are connected to “the divine.” This type of communion
might be experienced when people are pray or meditate. Religious beliefs are specific ideas members of a particular faith
hold to be true, such as that Jesus Christ was the son of God, or that reincarnation exists. Another illustration of religious
beliefs is the creation stories we find in different religions. Religious rituals are behaviors or practices that are either
required or expected of the members of a particular group, such as bar mitzvah or confession of sins (Barkan and
Greenwood 2003).

The History of Religion as a Sociological Concept
In the wake of nineteenth century European industrialization and secularization, three social theorists attempted to
examine the relationship between religion and society: Émile Durkheim, Max Weber, and Karl Marx. They are among the
founding thinkers of modern sociology.
As stated earlier, French sociologist Émile Durkheim (1858–1917) defined religion as a “unified system of beliefs and
practices relative to sacred things” (1915). To him, sacred meant extraordinary—something that inspired wonder and that
seemed connected to the concept of “the divine.” Durkheim argued that “religion happens” in society when there is a
separation between the profane (ordinary life) and the sacred (1915). A rock, for example, isn’t sacred or profane as it
exists. But if someone makes it into a headstone, or another person uses it for landscaping, it takes on different
meanings—one sacred, one profane.
Durkheim is generally considered the first sociologist who analyzed religion in terms of its societal impact. Above all, he
believed religion is about community: It binds people together (social cohesion), promotes behavior consistency (social
control), and offers strength during life’s transitions and tragedies (meaning and purpose). By applying the methods of
natural science to the study of society, Durkheim held that the source of religion and morality is the collective mind-set of
society and that the cohesive bonds of social order result from common values in a society. He contended that these values
need to be maintained to maintain social stability.

But what would happen if religion were to decline? This question led Durkheim to posit that religion is not just a social
creation but something that represents the power of society: When people celebrate sacred things, they celebrate the power
of their society. By this reasoning, even if traditional religion disappeared, society wouldn’t necessarily dissolve.
Whereas Durkheim saw religion as a source of social stability, German sociologist and political economist Max Weber
(1864–1920) believed it was a precipitator of social change. He examined the effects of religion on economic activities
and noticed that heavily Protestant societies—such as those in the Netherlands, England, Scotland, and Germany—were
the most highly developed capitalist societies and that their most successful business leaders were Protestant. In his
writing The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism (1905), he contends that the Protestant work ethic influenced the
development of capitalism. Weber noted that certain kinds of Protestantism supported the pursuit of material gain by
motivating believers to work hard, be successful, and not spend their profits on frivolous things. (The modern use of
“work ethic” comes directly from Weber’s Protestant ethic, although it has now lost its religious connotations.)

the

Big Picture

The Protestant Work Ethic in the Information Age
Max Weber (1904) posited that, in Europe in his time, Protestants were more likely than Catholics to value capitalist
ideology, and believed in hard work and savings. He showed that Protestant values directly influenced the rise of
capitalism and helped create the modern world order. Weber thought the emphasis on community in Catholicism
versus the emphasis on individual achievement in Protestantism made a difference. His century-old claim that the
Protestant work ethic led to the development of capitalism has been one of the most important and controversial
topics in the sociology of religion. In fact, scholars have found little merit to his contention when applied to modern
society (Greeley 1989).
What does the concept of work ethic mean today? The work ethic in the information age has been affected by
tremendous cultural and social change, just as workers in the mid- to late nineteenth century were influenced by the
wake of the Industrial Revolution. Factory jobs tend to be simple, uninvolved, and require very little thinking or
decision making on the part of the worker. Today, the work ethic of the modern workforce has been transformed, as
more thinking and decision making is required. Employees also seek autonomy and fulfillment in their jobs, not just
wages. Higher levels of education have become necessary, as well as people management skills and access to the
most recent information on any given topic. The information age has increased the rapid pace of production expected
in many jobs.
On the other hand, the “McDonaldization” of the United States (Hightower 1975; Ritzer 1993), in which many
service industries, such as the fast-food industry, have established routinized roles and tasks, has resulted in a
“discouragement” of the work ethic. In jobs where roles and tasks are highly prescribed, workers have no opportunity
to make decisions. They are considered replaceable commodities as opposed to valued employees. During times of
recession, these service jobs may be the only employment possible for younger individuals or those with low-level
skills. The pay, working conditions, and robotic nature of the tasks dehumanizes the workers and strips them of
incentives for doing quality work.
Working hard also doesn’t seem to have any relationship with Catholic or Protestant religious beliefs anymore, or
those of other religions; information age workers expect talent and hard work to be rewarded by material gain and
career advancement.
German philosopher, journalist, and revolutionary socialist Karl Marx (1818–1883) also studied the social impact of
religion. He believed religion reflects the social stratification of society and that it maintains inequality and perpetuates the
status quo. For him, religion was just an extension of working-class (proletariat) economic suffering. He famously argued
that religion “is the opium of the people” (1844).
For Durkheim, Weber, and Marx, who were reacting to the great social and economic upheaval of the late nineteenth
century and early twentieth century in Europe, religion was an integral part of society. For Durkheim, religion was a force
for cohesion that helped bind the members of society to the group, while Weber believed religion could be understood as
something separate from society. Marx considered religion inseparable from the economy and the worker. Religion could
not be understood apart from the capitalist society that perpetuated inequality. Despite their different views, these social
theorists all believed in the centrality of religion to society.

Theoretical Perspectives on Religion

Figure 15.2 Functionalists believe religion meets many important needs for people, including group cohesion and companionship. (Photo

Modern-day sociologists often apply one of three major theoretical perspectives. These views offer different lenses
through which to study and understand society: functionalism, symbolic interactionism, and conflict theory. Let’s explore
how scholars applying these paradigms understand religion.
Functionalism
Functionalists contend that religion serves several functions in society. Religion, in fact, depends on society for its
existence, value, and significance, and vice versa. From this perspective, religion serves several purposes, like providing
answers to spiritual mysteries, offering emotional comfort, and creating a place for social interaction and social control.
In providing answers, religion defines the spiritual world and spiritual forces, including divine beings. For example, it
helps answer questions like, “How was the world created?” “Why do we suffer?” “Is there a plan for our lives?” and “Is
there an afterlife?” As another function, religion provides emotional comfort in times of crisis. Religious rituals bring
order, comfort, and organization through shared familiar symbols and patterns of behavior.
One of the most important functions of religion, from a functionalist perspective, is the opportunities it creates for social
interaction and the formation of groups. It provides social support and social networking and offers a place to meet others
who hold similar values and a place to seek help (spiritual and material) in times of need. Moreover, it can foster group
cohesion and integration. Because religion can be central to many people’s concept of themselves, sometimes there is an
“in-group” versus “out-group” feeling toward other religions in our society or within a particular practice. On an extreme
level, the Inquisition, the Salem witch trials, and anti-Semitism are all examples of this dynamic. Finally, religion
promotes social control: It reinforces social norms such as appropriate styles of dress, following the law, and regulating
sexual behavior.
Conflict Theory
Conflict theorists view religion as an institution that helps maintain patterns of social inequality. For example, the Vatican
has a tremendous amount of wealth, while the average income of Catholic parishioners is small. According to this
perspective, religion has been used to support the “divine right” of oppressive monarchs and to justify unequal social
structures, like India’s caste system.
Conflict theorists are critical of the way many religions promote the idea that believers should be satisfied with existing
circumstances because they are divinely ordained. This power dynamic has been used by Christian institutions for
centuries to keep poor people poor and to teach them that they shouldn’t be concerned with what they lack because their
“true” reward (from a religious perspective) will come after death. Conflict theorists also point out that those in power in a
religion are often able to dictate practices, rituals, and beliefs through their interpretation of religious texts or via
proclaimed direct communication from the divine.

gender inequality and promote leadership roles for women in religion. (Photo courtesy of Wikimedia Commons)

The feminist perspective is a conflict theory view that focuses specifically on gender inequality. In terms of religion,
feminist theorists assert that, although women are typically the ones to socialize children into a religion, they have
traditionally held very few positions of power within religions. A few religions and religious denominations are more
gender equal, but male dominance remains the norm of most.

Real World

Rational Choice Theory: Can Economic Theory Be
Applied to Religion?
How do people decide which religion to follow, if any? How does one pick a church or decide which denomination
“fits” best? Rational choice theory (RCT) is one way social scientists have attempted to explain these behaviors. The
theory proposes that people are self-interested, though not necessarily selfish, and that people make rational
choices—choices that can reasonably be expected to maximize positive outcomes while minimizing negative
outcomes. Sociologists Roger Finke and Rodney Stark (1988) first considered the use of RCT to explain some
aspects of religious behavior, with the assumption that there is a basic human need for religion in terms of providing
belief in a supernatural being, a sense of meaning in life, and belief in life after death. Religious explanations of these
concepts are presumed to be more satisfactory than scientific explanations, which may help to account for the
continuation of strong religious connectedness in countries such as the United States, despite predictions of some
competing theories for a great decline in religious affiliation due to modernization and religious pluralism.
Another assumption of RCT is that religious organizations can be viewed in terms of “costs” and “rewards.” Costs
are not only monetary requirements, but are also the time, effort, and commitment demands of any particular religious
organization. Rewards are the intangible benefits in terms of belief and satisfactory explanations about life, death, and
the supernatural, as well as social rewards from membership. RCT proposes that, in a pluralistic society with many
religious options, religious organizations will compete for members, and people will choose between different
churches or denominations in much the same way they select other consumer goods, balancing costs and rewards in a
rational manner. In this framework, RCT also explains the development and decline of churches, denominations,
sects, and even cults; this limited part of the very complex RCT theory is the only aspect well supported by research
data.
Critics of RCT argue that it doesn’t fit well with human spiritual needs, and many sociologists disagree that the costs
and rewards of religion can even be meaningfully measured or that individuals use a rational balancing process
regarding religious affiliation. The theory doesn’t address many aspects of religion that individuals may consider
essential (such as faith) and further fails to account for agnostics and atheists who don’t seem to have a similar need
for religious explanations. Critics also believe this theory overuses economic terminology and structure and point out
that terms such as “rational” and “reward” are unacceptably defined by their use; they would argue that the theory is
based on faulty logic and lacks external, empirical support. A scientific explanation for why something occurs can’t
reasonably be supported by the fact that it does occur. RCT is widely used in economics and to a lesser extent in
criminal justice, but the application of RCT in explaining the religious beliefs and behaviors of people and societies is
still being debated in sociology today.

Symbolic Interactionism
Rising from the concept that our world is socially constructed, symbolic interactionism studies the symbols and
interactions of everyday life. To interactionists, beliefs and experiences are not sacred unless individuals in a society
regard them as sacred. The Star of David in Judaism, the cross in Christianity, and the crescent and star in Islam are
examples of sacred symbols. Interactionists are interested in what these symbols communicate. Because interactionists
study one-on-one, everyday interactions between individuals, a scholar using this approach might ask questions focused on
this dynamic. The interaction between religious leaders and practitioners, the role of religion in the ordinary components
of everyday life, and the ways people express religious values in social interactions—all might be topics of study to an
interactionist.

15.2 World Religions

Figure 15.4 The symbols of fourteen religions are depicted here. In no particular order, they represent Judaism, Wicca, Taoism, Christianity,

What might a symbolic interactionist make of these symbols? (Photo courtesy of ReligiousTolerance.org (http://ReligiousTolerance.org) )

The major religions of the world (Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam, Confucianism, Christianity, Taoism, and Judaism) differ in
many respects, including how each religion is organized and the belief system each upholds. Other differences include the
nature of belief in a higher power, the history of how the world and the religion began, and the use of sacred texts and
objects.

Types of Religious Organizations
Religions organize themselves—their institutions, practitioners, and structures—in a variety of fashions. For instance,
when the Roman Catholic Church emerged, it borrowed many of its organizational principles from the ancient Roman
military and turned senators into cardinals, for example. Sociologists use different terms, like ecclesia, denomination, and
sect, to define these types of organizations. Scholars are also aware that these definitions are not static. Most religions
transition through different organizational phases. For example, Christianity began as a cult, transformed into a sect, and
today exists as an ecclesia.
Cults, like sects, are new religious groups. In the United States today this term often carries pejorative connotations.
However, almost all religions began as cults and gradually progressed to levels of greater size and organization. The term
cult is sometimes used interchangeably with the term new religious movement (NRM). In its pejorative use, these groups
are often disparaged as being secretive, highly controlling of members’ lives, and dominated by a single, charismatic
leader.
Controversy exists over whether some groups are cults, perhaps due in part to media sensationalism over groups like
polygamous Mormons or the Peoples Temple followers who died at Jonestown, Guyana. Some groups that are
controversially labeled as cults today include the Church of Scientology and the Hare Krishna movement.
A sect is a small and relatively new group. Most of the well-known Christian denominations in the United States today
began as sects. For example, the Methodists and Baptists protested against their parent Anglican Church in England, just
as Henry VIII protested against the Catholic Church by forming the Anglican Church. From “protest” comes the term
Protestant.

Occasionally, a sect is a breakaway group that may be in tension with larger society. They sometimes claim to be returning
to “the fundamentals” or to contest the veracity of a particular doctrine. When membership in a sect increases over time, it
may grow into a denomination. Often a sect begins as an offshoot of a denomination, when a group of members believes
they should separate from the larger group.
Some sects dissolve without growing into denominations. Sociologists call these established sects. Established sects, such
as the Amish or Jehovah’s Witnesses fall halfway between sect and denomination on the ecclesia–cult continuum because
they have a mixture of sect-like and denomination-like characteristics.
A denomination is a large, mainstream religious organization, but it does not claim to be official or state sponsored. It is
one religion among many. For example, Baptist, African Methodist Episcopal, Catholic, and Seventh-day Adventist are all
Christian denominations.
The term ecclesia, originally referring to a political assembly of citizens in ancient Athens, Greece, now refers to a
congregation. In sociology, the term is used to refer to a religious group that most all members of a society belong to. It is
considered a nationally recognized, or official, religion that holds a religious monopoly and is closely allied with state and
secular powers. The United States does not have an ecclesia by this standard; in fact, this is the type of religious
organization that many of the first colonists came to America to escape.

One way to remember these religious organizational terms is to think of cults, sects, denominations, and ecclesia
representing a continuum, with increasing influence on society, where cults are least influential and ecclesia are most
influential.

Types of Religions
Scholars from a variety of disciplines have strived to classify religions. One widely accepted categorization that helps
people understand different belief systems considers what or who people worship (if anything). Using this method of
classification, religions might fall into one of these basic categories, as shown in Table 15.1.

340

Chapter 15 | Religion

Table 15.1 One way scholars have categorized religions is by classifying what or who they hold to be
divine.

Atheism

Atheism

Animism

Nonhuman beings (animals, plants,
natural world)

Indigenous nature worship (Shinto)

Totemism

Human-natural being connection

Ojibwa (Native American) beliefs

Note that some religions may be practiced—or understood—in various categories. For instance, the Christian notion of the
Holy Trinity (God, Jesus, Holy Spirit) defies the definition of monotheism, which is a religion based on belief in a single
deity, to some scholars. Similarly, many Westerners view the multiple manifestations of Hinduism’s godhead as
polytheistic, which is a religion based on belief in multiple deities,, while Hindus might describe those manifestations are
a monotheistic parallel to the Christian Trinity. Some Japanese practice Shinto, which follows animism, which is a
religion that believes in the divinity of nonhuman beings, like animals, plants, and objects of the natural world, while
people who practice totemism believe in a divine connection between humans and other natural beings.
It is also important to note that every society also has nonbelievers, such as atheists, who do not believe in a divine being
or entity, and agnostics, who hold that ultimate reality (such as God) is unknowable. While typically not an organized
group, atheists and agnostics represent a significant portion of the population. It is important to recognize that being a
nonbeliever in a divine entity does not mean the individual subscribes to no morality. Indeed, many Nobel Peace Prize
winners and other great humanitarians over the centuries would have classified themselves as atheists or agnostics.

The World’s Religions
Religions have emerged and developed across the world. Some have been short-lived, while others have persisted and
grown. In this section, we will explore seven of the world’s major religions.
Hinduism
The oldest religion in the world, Hinduism originated in the Indus River Valley about 4,500 years ago in what is now
modern-day northwest India and Pakistan. It arose contemporaneously with ancient Egyptian and Mesopotamian cultures.
With roughly one billion followers, Hinduism is the third-largest of the world’s religions. Hindus believe in a divine power
that can manifest as different entities. Three main incarnations—Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva—are sometimes compared to
the manifestations of the divine in the Christian Trinity.
Multiple sacred texts, collectively called the Vedas, contain hymns and rituals from ancient India and are mostly written in
Sanskrit. Hindus generally believe in a set of principles called dharma, which refer to one’s duty in the world that
corresponds with “right” actions. Hindus also believe in karma, or the notion that spiritual ramifications of one’s actions
are balanced cyclically in this life or a future life (reincarnation).

festivals. (Photo courtesy of Akash Mazumdar)

Buddhist leaders. (Photo courtesy of Nancy Pelosi/flickr)

Buddhism
Buddhism was founded by Siddhartha Gautama around 500 B.C.E. Siddhartha was said to have given up a comfortable,
upper-class life to follow one of poverty and spiritual devotion. At the age of thirty-five, he famously meditated under a
sacred fig tree and vowed not to rise before he achieved enlightenment (bodhi). After this experience, he became known as
Buddha, or “enlightened one.” Followers were drawn to Buddha’s teachings and the practice of meditation, and he later
established a monastic order.

Figure 15.8 Meditation is an important practice in Buddhism. A Tibetan monk is shown here engaged in solitary meditation. (Photo courtesy of
Prince Roy/flickr)

Buddha’s teachings encourage Buddhists to lead a moral life by accepting the four Noble Truths: 1) life is suffering, 2)
suffering arises from attachment to desires, 3) suffering ceases when attachment to desires ceases, and 4) freedom from
suffering is possible by following the “middle way.” The concept of the “middle way” is central to Buddhist thinking,
which encourages people to live in the present and to practice acceptance of others (Smith 1991). Buddhism also tends to
deemphasize the role of a godhead, instead stressing the importance of personal responsibility (Craig 2002).
Confucianism
Confucianism was the official religion of China from 200 B.C.E. until it was officially abolished when communist
leadership discouraged religious practice in 1949. The religion was developed by Kung Fu-Tzu (Confucius), who lived in
the sixth and fifth centuries B.C.E. An extraordinary teacher, his lessons—which were about self-discipline, respect for
authority and tradition, and jen (the kind treatment of every person)—were collected in a book called the Analects.
Some religious scholars consider Confucianism more of a social system than a religion because it focuses on sharing
wisdom about moral practices but doesn’t involve any type of specific worship; nor does it have formal objects. In fact, its
teachings were developed in context of problems of social anarchy and a near-complete deterioration of social cohesion.

342

Chapter 15 | Religion

Dissatisfied with the social solutions put forth, Kung Fu-Tzu developed his own model of religious morality to help guide
society (Smith 1991).
Taoism
In Taoism, the purpose of life is inner peace and harmony. Tao is usually translated as “way” or “path.” The founder of the
religion is generally recognized to be a man named Laozi, who lived sometime in the sixth century B.C.E. in China. Taoist
beliefs emphasize the virtues of compassion and moderation.
The central concept of tao can be understood to describe a spiritual reality, the order of the universe, or the way of modern
life in harmony with the former two. The ying-yang symbol and the concept of polar forces are central Taoist ideas (Smith
1991). Some scholars have compared this Chinese tradition to its Confucian counterpart by saying that “whereas
Confucianism is concerned with day-to-day rules of conduct, Taoism is concerned with a more spiritual level of being”
(Feng and English 1972).
Judaism
After their Exodus from Egypt in the thirteenth century B.C.E., Jews, a nomadic society, became monotheistic,
worshipping only one God. The Jews’ covenant, or promise of a special relationship with Yahweh (God), is an important
element of Judaism, and their sacred text is the Torah, which Christians also follow as the first five books of the Bible.
Talmud refers to a collection of sacred Jewish oral interpretation of the Torah. Jews emphasize moral behavior and action
in this world as opposed to beliefs or personal salvation in the next world.

Figure 15.9 The Islamic house of worship is called a mosque. (Photo courtesy of David Stanley/flickr)
Islam
Islam is monotheistic religion and it follows the teaching of the prophet Muhammad, born in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, in 570
C.E. Muhammad is seen only as a prophet, not as a divine being, and he is believed to be the messenger of Allah (God),
who is divine. The followers of Islam, whose U.S. population is projected to double in the next twenty years (Pew
Research Forum 2011), are called Muslims.
Islam means “peace” and “submission.” The sacred text for Muslims is the Qur’an (or Koran). As with Christianity’s Old
Testament, many of the Qur’an stories are shared with the Jewish faith. Divisions exist within Islam, but all Muslims are
guided by five beliefs or practices, often called “pillars”: 1) Allah is the only god, and Muhammad is his prophet, 2) daily
prayer, 3) helping those in poverty, 4) fasting as a spiritual practice, and 5) pilgrimage to the holy center of Mecca.

Christianity
Today the largest religion in the world, Christianity began 2,000 years ago in Palestine, with Jesus of Nazareth, a
charismatic leader who taught his followers about caritas (charity) or treating others as you would like to be treated
yourself.
The sacred text for Christians is the Bible. While Jews, Christians, and Muslims share many of same historical religious
stories, their beliefs verge. In their shared sacred stories, it is suggested that the son of God—a messiah—will return to
save God’s followers. While Christians believe that he already appeared in the person of Jesus Christ, Jews and Muslims
disagree. While they recognize Christ as an important historical figure, their traditions don’t believe he’s the son of God,
and their faiths see the prophecy of the messiah’s arrival as not yet fulfilled.
Different Christian groups have variations among their sacred texts. For instance, Mormons, an established Christian sect,
also use the Book of Mormon, which they believe details other parts of Christian doctrine and Jesus’ life that aren’t
included in the Bible. Similarly, the Catholic Bible includes the Apocrypha, a collection that, while part of the 1611 King
James translation, is no longer included in Protestant versions of the Bible. Although monotheistic, Christians often
describe their god through three manifestations that they call the Holy Trinity: the father (God), the son (Jesus), and the
Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is a term Christians often use to describe religious experience, or how they feel the presence
of the sacred in their lives. One foundation of Christian doctrine is the Ten Commandments, which decry acts considered
sinful, including theft, murder, and adultery.

15.3 Religion in the United States
In examining the state of religion in the United States today, we see the complexity of religious life in our society, plus
emerging trends like the rise of the megachurch, secularization, and the role of religion in social change.

Religion and Social Change
Religion has historically been an impetus to social change. The translation of sacred texts into everyday, nonscholarly
language empowered people to shape their religions. Disagreements between religious groups and instances of religious
persecution have led to wars and genocides. The United States is no stranger to religion as an agent of social change. In
fact, the United States' first European arrivals were acting largely on religious convictions when they were compelled to
settle in the United States.

Liberation Theology
Liberation theology began as a movement within the Roman Catholic Church in the 1950s and 1960s in Latin America,
and it combines Christian principles with political activism. It uses the church to promote social change via the political
arena, and it is most often seen in attempts to reduce or eliminate social injustice, discrimination, and poverty. A list of
proponents of this kind of social justice (although some pre-date liberation theory) could include Francis of Assisi, Leo
Tolstoy, Martin Luther King Jr., and Desmond Tutu.
Although begun as a moral reaction against the poverty caused by social injustice in that part of the world, today liberation
theology is an international movement that encompasses many churches and denominations. Liberation theologians
discuss theology from the point of view of the poor and the oppressed, and some interpret the scriptures as a call to action
against poverty and injustice. In Europe and North America, feminist theology has emerged from liberation theology as a
movement to bring social justice to women.

Social Policy

& Debate

Religious Leaders and the Rainbow of Gay Pride
What happens when a religious leader officiates a gay marriage against denomination policies? What about when that
same minister defends the action in part by coming out and making her own lesbian relationship known to the
church?
In the case of the Reverend Amy DeLong, it meant a church trial. Some leaders in her denomination assert that
homosexuality is incompatible with their faith, while others feel this type of discrimination has no place in a modern
church (Barrick 2011).
As the LBGT community increasingly advocates for, and earns, basic civil rights, how will religious communities
respond? Many religious groups have traditionally discounted LBGT sexualities as “wrong.” However, these
organizations have moved closer to respecting human rights by, for example, increasingly recognizing females as an
equal gender. The Roman Catholic Church drew controversial attention to this issue in 2010 when the Vatican
secretary of state suggested homosexuality was in part to blame for pedophilic sexual abuse scandals that have
plagued the church (Beck 2010). Because numerous studies have shown there to be no relationship between
homosexuality and pedophilia, nor a higher incidence of pedophilia among homosexuals than among heterosexuals
(Beck 2010), the Vatican’s comments seem suspect. More recently Pope Francis has been pushing for a more open
church, and some Catholic bishops have been advocating for a more ""gay-friendly"" church (McKenna, 2014). This
has not come to pass, but some scholars believe these changes are a matter of time.
No matter the situation, most religions have a tenuous (at best) relationship with practitioners and leaders in the gay
community. As one of the earliest Christian denominations to break barriers by ordaining women to serve as pastors,
will Amy DeLong’s United Methodist denomination also be a leader in LBGT rights within Christian churchgoing
society?

Megachurches
A megachurch is a Christian church that has a very large congregation averaging more than 2,000 people who attend
regular weekly services. As of 2009, the largest megachurch in the United States was in Houston Texas, boasting an
average weekly attendance of more than 43,000 (Bogan 2009). Megachurches exist in other parts of the world, especially
in South Korea, Brazil, and several African countries, but the rise of the megachurch in the United States is a fairly recent
phenomenon that has developed primarily in California, Florida, Georgia, and Texas.
Since 1970 the number of megachurches in this country has grown from about fifty to more than 1,000, most of which are
attached to the Southern Baptist denomination (Bogan 2009). Approximately six million people are members of these
churches (Bird and Thumma 2011). The architecture of these church buildings often resembles a sport or concert arena.
The church may include jumbotrons (large-screen televisual technology usually used in sports arenas to show close-up
shots of an event). Worship services feature contemporary music with drums and electric guitars and use state-of-the-art
sound equipment. The buildings sometimes include food courts, sports and recreation facilities, and bookstores. Services
such as child care and mental health counseling are often offered.
Typically, a single, highly charismatic pastor leads the megachurch; at present, most are male. Some megachurches and
their preachers have a huge television presence, and viewers all around the country watch and respond to their shows and
fundraising.
Besides size, U.S. megachurches share other traits, including conservative theology, evangelism, use of technology and
social networking (Facebook, Twitter, podcasts, blogs), hugely charismatic leaders, few financial struggles, multiple sites,
and predominantly white membership. They list their main focuses as youth activities, community service, and study of
the Scripture (Hartford Institute for Religion Research b).
Critics of megachurches believe they are too large to promote close relationships among fellow church members or the
pastor, as could occur in smaller houses of worship. Supporters note that, in addition to the large worship services,
congregations generally meet in small groups, and some megachurches have informal events throughout the week to allow
for community-building (Hartford Institute for Religion Research a).

Secularization
Historical sociologists Émile Durkheim, Max Weber, and Karl Marx and psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud anticipated
secularization and claimed that the modernization of society would bring about a decrease in the influence of religion.
Weber believed membership in distinguished clubs would outpace membership in Protestant sects as a way for people to
gain authority or respect.
Conversely, some people suggest secularization is a root cause of many social problems, such as divorce, drug use, and
educational downturn. One-time presidential contender Michele Bachmann even linked Hurricane Irene and the 2011
earthquake felt in Washington D.C. to politicians’ failure to listen to God (Ward 2011).
While some scholars see the United States becoming increasingly secular, others observe a rise in fundamentalism.
Compared to other democratic, industrialized countries, the United States is generally perceived to be a fairly religious
nation. Whereas 65 percent of U.S. adults in a 2009 Gallup survey said religion was an important part of their daily lives,
the numbers were lower in Spain (49 percent), Canada (42 percent), France (30 percent), the United Kingdom (27
percent), and Sweden (17 percent) (Crabtree and Pelham 2009). Secularization interests social observers because it entails
a pattern of change in a fundamental social institution.

Thank God for that Touchdown: Separation of Church
and State
Imagine three public universities with football games scheduled on Saturday. At University A, a group of students in
the stands who share the same faith decide to form a circle amid the spectators to pray for the team. For fifteen
minutes, people in the circle share their prayers aloud among their group. At University B, the team ahead at halftime
decides to join together in prayer, giving thanks and seeking support from God. This lasts for the first ten minutes of
halftime on the sidelines of the field while spectators watch. At University C, the game program includes, among its
opening moments, two minutes set aside for the team captain to share a prayer of his choosing with the spectators.
In the tricky area of separation of church and state, which of these actions is allowed and which is forbidden? In our
three fictional scenarios, the last example is against the law while the first two situations are perfectly acceptable.
In the United States, a nation founded on the principles of religious freedom (many settlers were escaping religious
persecution in Europe), how stringently do we adhere to this ideal? How well do we respect people’s right to practice
any belief system of their choosing? The answer just might depend on what religion you practice.
In 2003, for example, a lawsuit escalated in Alabama regarding a monument to the Ten Commandments in a public
building. In response, a poll was conducted by USA Today, CNN, and Gallup. Among the findings: 70 percent of
people approved of a Christian Ten Commandments monument in public, while only 33 percent approved of a
monument to the Islamic Qur’an in the same space. Similarly, survey respondents showed a 64 percent approval of
social programs run by Christian organizations, but only 41 percent approved of the same programs run by Muslim
groups (Newport 2003).
These statistics suggest that, for most people in the United States, freedom of religion is less important than the
religion under discussion. And this is precisely the point made by those who argue for separation of church and state.
According to their contention, any state-sanctioned recognition of religion suggests endorsement of one belief system
at the expense of all others—contradictory to the idea of freedom of religion.
So what violates separation of church and state and what is acceptable? Myriad lawsuits continue to test the answer.
In the case of the three fictional examples above, the issue of spontaneity is key, as is the existence (or lack thereof)
of planning on the part of event organizers.
The next time you’re at a state event—political, public school, community—and the topic of religion comes up,
consider where it falls in this debate.

Section Summary
15.1 The Sociological Approach to Religion
Religion describes the beliefs, values, and practices related to sacred or spiritual concerns. Social theorist Émile Durkheim
defined religion as a “unified system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things” (1915). Max Weber believed
religion could be a force for social change. Karl Marx viewed religion as a tool used by capitalist societies to perpetuate
inequality. Religion is a social institution, because it includes beliefs and practices that serve the needs of society. Religion
is also an example of a cultural universal, because it is found in all societies in one form or another. Functionalism,
conflict theory, and interactionism all provide valuable ways for sociologists to understand religion.

15.2 World Religions
Sociological terms for different kinds of religious organizations are, in order of decreasing influence in society, ecclesia,
denomination, sect, and cult. Religions can be categorized according to what or whom its followers worship. Some of the
major, and oldest, of the world’s religions include Hinduism, Buddhism, Confucianism, Taoism, Judaism, Islam, and
Christianity.

Liberation theology combines Christian principles with political activism to address social injustice, discrimination, and
poverty. Megachurches are those with a membership of more than 2,000 regular attendees, and they are a vibrant, growing
and highly influential segment of U.S. religious life. Some sociologists believe levels of religiosity in the United States are
declining (called secularization), while others observe a rise in fundamentalism.

Spend a few quick minutes discussing with participants how traditional teaching often prefers to
tell students what the answer to a problem is. By contrast, this exercise will encourage children
to think about the causes and effects of the problem. This exercise is not designed to find a
solution. It is designed to give students a deeper understanding of the problem and to think
analytically.
Now you want to demonstrate how we use the Problem Tree to analyze cause and effect. So first
you will need to decide what problem or issue to choose. Try and find out what the group thinks
is an issue that they all feel strongly about. Use that for your analysis.
Draw an outline of a tree on a big piece of paper with a marker (see Appendix F)
Make sure that the participants recognize that the illustration is a tree! Ask them what role the
roots play in a tree (‘they feed it and make the tree grow bigger’) and ensure they can recognize
the branches.
Write or draw the name of the problem on the trunk of the tree.
The next step is to identify the causes of the problem. Ask the participants to identify causes
(“Why is the problem there? What are the causes of this problem”). Listen to their answers and
ask them to justify their reasons. (‘Why do you think that? Who has a different opinion?’)
When people have agreed on a cause write it down on a card or a piece of paper. Keep going until
you have found five or six causes for the problem. Alternatively, simply write the answers directly
onto the roots.
If you have time, ask the participants to place the cards on the roots in such a way that the most
serious are to the left and the less serious are to the right.
Now repeat the process by asking them to identify the effects. Again ask them to justify their
answers (‘Why do you think that? Who has a different opinion?’)
Write or draw them on separate cards. Ask them to place the cards on the branches so that the
most serious are to the left and the less serious are to the right.
Once the diagram is ready, ask them to explain the whole thing. Also ask them to reflect on the
diagram and what it means.
If there is time, start a discussion among the participants exploring possible ‘solutions’ to deal
with the causes and effects of the problem. Make it clear that many people themselves can be
responsible for many of these solutions. From solutions you can move to the actions
that people might take. You might even add the solutions to the tree in the form of fruit.

Applying Problem Trees for key subjects in the national syllabus
Problem Trees are flexible and can be used to analyze cause and effects in many different
contexts. However they will work better for some subjects than others. Encourage teachers
to experiment with the tool. Here are examples of subjects and lessons, drawn from key
subjects typically found in a national curriculum and where Problem Trees might prove
useful.
Music
Topic: National or regional music and the influences on it. Elicit the following influential
factors on music from the students and place them against the roots of your tree.
 Changing life styles
 Proximity of different ethnic groups
 Effects of social interaction
 Effects of tourism
 Electronic and print media
 Modern technology
 Impact of alien cultures

Then ask the students what the effects of these influences have been and place
those across the branches.
Social Studies
The following themes might lend themselves to analysis with a Problem Tree.
Resources and Economic.
 Problems facing forests in our country
 The effects of mining on the environment
 Causes of conflict in society
 Urbanisation: explain the problems associated with the growth of urban
centres
People and Populations
 Identify factors influencing population growth
 Describe the consequences of population growth
Physical Environment
 Effects of climate change on migration and economic activities of people in this
country.
 Explain the factors that influence climate change and explain the impact of climate
change on human activities.
Agriculture
 Describe different types of pollution and their causes
 State the effects of pollution on the environment
Health Education
HIV/AIDS
 Modes of transmission
 Impact of HIV/AIDS on the individual, family and nation.",Problem Tree,Aflatoun Academy (en) >> Teacher Refresher Modules >> Problem Tree,"a problem tree is a wonderful active-learning method, helping children to look at a problem or issue in terms of cause and effect. problem trees feature in many of the aflatoun books. do you remember a session on problem trees at your aflatoun teacher-training workshop? we hope that you enjoy this module, that it helps refresh your memory, provides you with a fuller understanding of this aspect of active-learning and maybe even inspires you with some new ideas.. this is the topic tree aflatoun academy (en) >> teacher refresher modules >> problem tree",document

Note For The Teacher
Prior to the lesson, write the questions/statements listed in the Learn activity out on the
board so that the students may refer to them easily. Place the Problem Tree illustration
up on the wall where the students can see it easily.

Introduction:
The aim of this lesson is to explain the linkages between an identified problem and the causes and effects that particular problem has on an individual, as shown by the data collated on that problem. This is the start of competency,
when it comes to making sense of a problem and documenting it. Data regarding a problem is only useful and worthwhile if it is interpreted in such a way so as to help guide decision–making and give direction. The interpretation must
be clearly presented.

Start
1. Have the students form groups of six to eight, and give each group a sheet of paper and pencil.
10 m

2. Ask each group to brainstorm a list of as many things that they can think of that cause students their age
feel embarrassed. Explain that the group that comes up with the longest list will win a round of applause!
3. After five minutes, ask each group to present their list.

Learn
1. Ask the groups to remain in their groups, and assign one student from each group to be the group
‘reader’.
20 m

2. Give each reader a copy of the story, Koko Shares Her Secret.
3. Ask them to read the story to their fellow group members, and ask the other students to listen carefully,
as they will need to recognise key issues and be prepared to recall important facts and respond to
questions afterwards.
4. Once they have heard the story, collect the story sheets from the readers, and point out the questions/
statements written out on the board (below) to the students.
5. Ask them to work within their groups to complete each statement or answer each question (give the
groups more paper if necessary).

What happened to their friendship?
Answer: Koko and Jojo were not friends anymore.
Some good, however, did come out of the whole situation. State some.
Answer: Koko did end up getting food, and Jojo got his friend back.

6. Once they have done this, lead the students into a discussion with the following question:

• What can we learn from Koko’s story?
7. Be sure that the following points are covered and discussed:

• That people should keep promises and secrets, unless their secret is putting their (or someone else’s)
health or safety at risk.

• If people do share someone’s secret, they must inform that person and explain why they need to do so.
• People should apologise to each other.
• People should forgive one another.

Reflect
1. Inform the students that they will work as a class to create a Problem Tree that represents the problem in
Koko Shares Her Secret. Show the Problem Tree illustration to the students and explain each element.
10 m

2. Draw a large tree on the board or a large piece of paper (or have volunteer students do so).
3. Write the main problem down the trunk of the tree. Label each root with one of the causes of the
problem (include as many as possible), and the branches with all the effects of the problem.
4. While you work on the Problem Tree, lead the students into a discussion, using the following questions:

• Were you able to understand and interpret the problem? Why? How?
• What is the main lesson that you learnt from this activity? Why?
• If a friend started acting upset with you and didn’t tell you why, how could you find out the cause of
the problem?

• When might it be appropriate to share someone’s secret?

Note: This is the ideal opportunity to discuss the importance of telling a responsible adult if a friend’s health or safety is
at risk. An example of this would be if they share a secret about being abused.

Applying Learning In My Life
Encourage the students to create a Problem Tree with their friends or family about a problem that he/she is currently
facing. Have him/her then think about various solutions together with his/her friends/family to improve the situation.

Koko Shares Her Secret
Koko had told her classmate, Jojo, that she had not have enough food to eat and was hungry. She asked Jojo not to tell
anybody because Koko wanted this to be a secret. However, Jojo did not keep Koko’s secret, and he told others.
Koko was angry with Jojo over this, and ended up breaking up their friendship. Koko got scared and embarrassed, and
kept away from everybody. She accused Jojo of not being responsible and respectful.
This made Jojo sad. Jojo tried to apologise to Koko, but she refused to accept the apology. Koko was unforgiving. This
made Koko feel really sad.
Later, their friends intervened and they made up. Jojo made a promise to always keep others’ secrets unless a friend was
in danger or hurt. A plan was created for Koko to have lunch in school.
All ended well. Koko was no longer hungry. Jojo and Koko were friends again, and everybody was happy.

80,t_e6191e4a8dd8,c_4d3a3160b3db,0.9,0.9,c_4d3a3160b3db,2d curl formula,"here we build up to the formula for computing the two-dimensional curl of a vector field, reasoning through what partial derivative information corresponds to fluid rotation.  . - [voiceover] so after introducing the idea of fluid rotation in a vector field like this, let's start tightening up our grasp on this intuition to get something that we can actually apply formulas to. so a vector field like the one that i had there, that's two-dimensional, is given by a function that has a two-dimensional input and a two-dimensional output. and it's common to write the components of that output as the functions p and q. so, each one of those p and q, takes in two different variables as it's input. p and q. and what i want to do here, is talk about this idea of curl and you might write it down as just curl, curl of v, the vector field. which takes in the same inputs that the vector field does. and because this is the two-dimensional example, i might write, just to distinguish it from three-dimensional curl, which is something we'll get later on, two d curl of v. so you're kind of thinking of this as a differential thing, in the same way that you have, you know, a derivative, dx is gonna take in some kind of a function. and you give it a function and it gives you a new function, the derivative. here, you think of this  curl, as like an operator, you give it a function, a vector field function, and it gives you another function, which in this case will be scalar valued. and the reason it's scalar valued, is because at every given point, you want it to give you a number. so if i look back at the vector field, that i have here, we want, that at a point like this, where there's a lot of counter-clockwise rotation happening around it, for the curl function to return a positive number. but at a point like this, where there's some, where there's clockwise rotation happening around it, you want the curl to return a negative number. so, let's start thinking about what that should mean. and a good way to understand this two-dimensional curl function and start to get a feel for it, is to imagine the quintessential  curl scenario. well let's say you have a point and this here's going to be our point, xy, sitting of somewhere in space. and let's say there's no vector attached to it, as in the values, p and q, and x and y, are zero. and then let's say that to the right of it, you have a vector pointing straight up. above it, in the vector field, you have a vector pointing straight to the left, to it's left, you have one pointing straight down, and below it, you have one pointing straight to the right. so in terms of the functions, what that means, is this vector, to it's right, whatever point it's evaluated at, that's gonna be q is greater than zero. so this function q, that corresponds to the y component, the up and down component of each vector, when you evaluate it at this point, to the right of our xy point, q's gonna be greater than zero. where as if you evaluate it to the left over here, q would be less than zero, less than zero, in our kind of, perfect curl will be positive example. and then these bottom guys, if you start thinking about what this means for, you'd have a rightward vector below, and a leftward vector above, the one below it, whatever point you're evaluating that at, p, which gives us the kind of, left right component of these vectors, since it's the first component of the output, would have to be positive. and then above it, above it here, when you evaluate p at that point, would have to be negative. where as p, if you did it on the left and right points, would be equal to zero because there's no x component. and similarly q, if you did it on the top and bottom points, since there's no up and down component of those vectors, would also be zero. so this is just the, the very specific, almost contrived scenario that i'm looking at. and i want to say, hey if this should have positive curl, maybe if we look at the information, the partial derivative information to be specific, about p and q, in a scenario like this, it'll give us a way to quantify the idea of curl. and first let's look at p. so p starts positive, and as y increases, as the y value of our input increases, it goes from being positive to zero, to negative. so we would expect, that the partial derivative of p, with respect to y, so as we change that y component, moving up in the plane, and look at the x component of the vectors, that should be negative. that should be negative in circumstances where we want positive curl. so all of this we're looking at cases, you know the quintessential case where curl is positive. so evidently, this is a fact, that corresponds to positive curl. where as q, let's take a look at q. it starts negative, when you're at the left. and then becomes zero, then it becomes positive. so here, as x increases, q increases. so we're expecting that a partial derivative of q, with respect to x, should be positive. or at the very least, the situations where, the partial derivative of q with respect to x is positive, corresponds to positive two-dimensional curl. and in fact, it turns out, these guys tell us all you need to know. we can say as a formula, that the  curl,  curl, of our vector field v, as a function of x and y, is equal to the partial derivative of q with respect to x. partial derivative of q, with respect to x, and then i'm gonna subtract off the partial of p, with respect to y. because i want, when this is negative, for that to correspond with more positive  curl. so i'm gonna subtract off, partial of p, with respect to y. and this right here, is the formula for two-dimensional curl. which basically, you can think of it as a measure, at any given point you're asking, how much does the surrounding information to that point, look like this set-up, like this perfect counter-clockwise rotation set-up? and the more it looks like this set-up, the more this value will be positive. and if it was the opposite of this, if each of the vectors was turned around and you have clockwise rotation, each of these values will become the negative of what it had been before. so  curl would end up being negative. and in the next video, i'll show some examples of what it looks like to use this formula.. the title of the content is  curl formula","- [Voiceover] So after introducing the idea of fluid rotation in a vector field like this, let's start tightening up our grasp on

Partial derivative of q, with respect to x, and then I'm gonna subtract off the partial of p, with respect to y. Because I want, when this is negative, for that to correspond with more positive 2d curl. So I'm gonna subtract off, partial of p, with respect to y. And this right here, is the formula for two-dimensional curl.

And the more it looks like this set-up, the more this value will be positive. And if it was the opposite of this, if each of the vectors was turned around and you have clockwise rotation, each of these values will become the negative of what it had been before. So 2d curl would end up being negative. And in the next video, I'll show some examples of what it looks like to use this formula.",Curl,Khan Academy (English - CBSE India Curriculum) >> Math >> Multivariable calculus >> Derivatives of multivariable functions >> Curl,curl is a special version of the derivative for vector fields.  it can be nicely interpreted in terms of rotation in fluid flow.. this is the topic tree khan academy (english - cbse india curriculum) >> math >> multivariable calculus >> derivatives of multivariable functions >> curl,video
81,t_e6191e4a8dd8,c_0cdb899d8b01,0.9,0.9,c_0cdb899d8b01,2d curl nuance,"the meaning of positive curl in a fluid flow can sometimes look a bit different from the clear cut rotation-around-a-point examples discussed in previous videos.  . - [voiceover] in the last couple videos i've been talking about curl where if we have a two dimensional vector field v defined with component functions p and q, i've said that the  curl of that function v gives you a new function that also takes in x and y's inputs and it's formula is the partial derivative of q with respect to x minus the partial derivative of p with respect to y. and my hope is that this is more than just a formula and that you can understand how this represents fluid rotation in two dimensions but what i want to do here is show how the original intuition i gave for this formula might be a little oversimplified because for example, if we look at this, the partial q, partial x component, i said that you can imagine that q at some point starting off a little bit negative so the y component of the output is a little negative, then as you move positively in the x direction, it goes to being zero and then it goes to being a little bit positive, and with this particular picture, it's hopefully a little bit clear why this can correspond to counter-clockwise rotation in the fluid, but this is only a very specific circumstance for what partial q, partial x being positive could look like. it might also look like q's starting a little bit positive and then as you move in the x direction, it becomes even more positive and then even more positive. and according to the formula, this should contribute as much to positive curl as this very clear-cut whirlpool example, and to illustrate what this might look like, if we take a look at this vector field here, if we look at the center, this is kinda the clear-cut whirlpool counter-clockwise rotation example. and if we play the fluid flow, the fluid does indeed rotate counter-clockwise in the region. but contrast that with what goes on over here on the right. this doesn't look like rotation in that sense at all. instead the fluid particles are just kind of rushing up through it. but in fact, the curl in this region is going to be just as strong as it is over here, and i'll show that with a formula and kind of computing it through in just a moment, but the image that you might have in your mind is to imagine a paddle wheel of sorts where let's say it's got arms kind of like that and then you hold down with your thumb that middle portion, so even though the paddle wheel left to its own devices would just fly up, i want to say, let's say you're holding that down with your thumb but it's free to rotate. then the vectors on its left are pointing up but less strongly than the vectors on its right which are even greater, so if you imagine that setup and you have your paddle wheel there, then when you play the fluid rotation, holding your thumb down but letting the paddle wheel rotate freely, it's also going to rotate just as it would over here in the easier to see whirlpool example. and in terms of the formula, this is because a situation like this one here, where q goes from being negative to zero to positive, should be treated just the same as a situation like this as far as  curls is concerned, because this term in the  curl formula is going to come out the same for either one of these. and it's worth pointing out, by the way, curl isn't something that mathematicians and physicists came across trying to understand fluid flow. instead, they found this term as being significant and various other formulas and circumstances and i think electromagnetism might be where it originally came about. but then in trying to understand this formula, they realized that you can give a fluid flow interpretation that gives a very deep understanding of what's going on beyond just the symbols themselves. so let me go ahead and walk through this example in terms of the formula representing the vector field. it's a relatively straightforward formula actually. so p and q, that x component is going to be negative y and the y component, q, is equal to x. so when we apply our  curl formula and apply the partial q with respect to x, so partial of this second component with respect to x is just one, and then we subtract off the partial of p with respect to y which up here is negative one because p is just equal to negative y. so the  curl is equal to two and in particular, it's a constant two that doesn't depend on x and y, which is pretty unusual, most times that you apply  curl to a vector field you're going to get some kind of function of x and y. but the fact that this is constant, tells us that when we look over at this fluid flow, the sense in which curl, the formula for curl wants to say that rotation happens around the center is just as strong as it's supposed to happen over here on the right, or anywhere on the plane for that matter. so if we're playing this and if you imagine you have the paddle wheel in the center, evidently it would be rotating just as quickly as the paddle on the right even though it might, i don't know, to me, that feels a little unintuitive cause the one on the right i'm thinking, okay, you know, maybe there's a little bit more torque on the right side than there is on the left and that's kind of a counter-balancing act, but the idea that that's actually the same as the very clear-cut, i see the counter-clockwise rotation with my eyes, example in the center, does seem a little unusual. but i think it's important to understand what else two dimensional curl can look like and what else this formula might be representing. so with that, i'll see you next video.. the

82,t_e6191e4a8dd8,c_7a272096fe26,0.9,0.9,c_7a272096fe26,2d curl intuition,"a description of how vector fields relate to fluid rotation, laying the intuition for what the operation of curl represents.  . - [voiceover] hello everyone. so i'm gonna start talking about curl. curl is one of those very cool vector calculus concepts, and you'll be pretty happy that you've learned it once you have, if for no other reason because it's kind of artistically pleasing. and, there's two different versions, there's a two-dimensional curl and a three-dimensional curl. and naturally enough, i'll start talking about the two-dimensional version and kind of build our way up to the  one. and in this particular video, i just want to lay down the intuition for what's visually going on. and, curl has to do with the fluid flow interpretation of vector fields. now this is something that i've talked about in other videos, especially the ones on divergents if you watch that, but just as a reminder, you kind of imagine that each point in space is a particle, like an air molecule or a water molecule. and since what a vector field does is associate each point in space with some kind of vector, now remember we don't always draw every single vector, we just draw a small sub-sample, but in principle, every single point in space has a vector attached to it. you can think of each particle, each one of these water molecules or air molecules, as moving over time in such a way that the velocity vector of its movement at any given point in time is the vector that it's attached to. so as it moves to a different location in space and that velocity vector changes, it might be turning or it might be accelerating, and that velocity might change. and you end up kind of a trajectory for your point. and since every single point is moving in this way, you can start thinking about a flow, kind of a global view of the vector field. and for this particular example, this particular vector field that i have pictured, i'm gonna go ahead and put a blue dot at various points in space, and, each one of these you can think of as representing a water molecule or something, and i'm just gonna let it play. and at any given moment, if you look at the movement of one of these blue dots, it's moving along the vector that it's attached to at that point, or if that vector's not pictured, you know the vector that would be attached to it at that point. and as we get kind of a feel for what's going on in this entire flow, i want you to notice a couple of particular regions. first, let's take a look at this region over here on the right. kind of around here. and just kind of concentrate on what's going on there. and i'll go ahead and start playing the animation over here. and what's most noticeable about this region is that there's counterclockwise rotation. and this corresponds to an idea that the vector field has a curl here, and i'll go very specifically into what curl means, but just right now you should have the idea that in a region where there's counterclockwise rotation, we want to say the curl is positive. whereas, if you look at a region that also has rotation, but clockwise, going the other way, we think of that as being negative curl. here i'll start it over here. and in contrast, if you look at a place where there's no rotation, where like at the center here, you have some points coming in from the top right and from the bottom left, and then going out from the other corners. but there's no net rotation. if you were to just put like a twig somewhere in this water, it wouldn't really be rotating. these are regions where you think of them as having zero curl. so with that as a general idea, clockwise rotation regions correspond to positive curl. counterclockwise rotation regions correspond to negative curl, and then no rotation corresponds to zero curl. in the next video i'm gonna start going through what this means in terms of the underlying function defining the vector field and how we can start looking at the partial differential information of that function to quantify this intuition of fluid rotation. and what's neat is that it's not just about fluid rotation. if you have vector fields in other context and you just imagine that they represent a fluid, even though they don't, this idea rotation and curling actually has certain importance in ways that you totally wouldn't expect. the gradient turns out to relate to the curl, even though you wouldn't necessarily think the grading has something to do with fluid rotation. in electromagnetism, this idea of fluid rotation has a certain importance, even though fluids aren't actually involved. so, it's more general than just the representation that we have here, but it's a very strong visual to have in your mind as you study vector fields.. the title of the content is  curl intuition","- [Voiceover] Hello everyone. So I'm gonna start talking about curl. Curl is one of those very cool vector calculus concepts, and you'll be pretty happy that you've learned it once you have, if for no other reason because it's kind of artistically pleasing. And, there's two different versions, there's a two-dimensional curl and a three-dimensional curl. And naturally enough, I'll start talking about the two-dimensional version and kind of build our way up to the 3D one. And in this particular video, I just want to lay down the intuition for what's visually going on. And, curl has to do with the fluid flow interpretation of vector fields. Now this is something that I've talked about in other videos, especially the ones on divergents if you watch that, but just as a reminder, you kind of imagine that each point in space is a particle, like an air molecule or a water molecule. And since what a vector field does is associate each point in space with some kind of vector, now remember we don't always draw every single vector, we just draw a small sub-sample, but in principle, every single point in space has a vector attached to it. You can think of each particle, each one of these water molecules or air molecules, as moving over time in such a way that the velocity vector of its movement at any given point in time is the vector that it's attached to. So as it moves to a different location in space and that velocity vector changes, it might be turning or it might be accelerating, and that velocity might change. And you end up kind of a trajectory for your point. And since every single point is moving in this way, you can start thinking about a flow, kind of a global view of the vector field. And for this particular example, this particular vector field that I have pictured, I'm gonna go ahead and put a blue dot at various points in space, and, each one of these you can think of as representing a water molecule or something, and I'm just gonna let it play. And at any given moment, if you look at the movement of one of these blue dots, it's moving along the vector that it's attached to at that point, or if that vector's not pictured, you know the vector that would be attached to it at that point. And as we get kind of a feel for what's going on in this entire flow, I want you to notice a couple of particular regions. First, let's take a look at this region over here on the right. Kind of around here. And just kind of concentrate on what's going on there. And I'll go ahead and start playing the animation over here. And what's most noticeable about this region is that there's counterclockwise rotation. And this corresponds to an idea that the vector field has a curl here, and I'll go very specifically into what curl means, but just right now you should have the idea that in a region where there's counterclockwise rotation, we want to say the curl is positive. Whereas, if you look at a region that also has rotation, but clockwise, going the other way, we think of that as being negative curl. Here I'll start it over here. And in contrast, if you look at a place where there's no rotation, where like at the center here, you have some points coming in from the top right and from the bottom left, and then going out from the other corners. But there's no net rotation. If you were to just put like a twig somewhere in this water, it wouldn't really be rotating. These are regions where you think of them as having zero curl. So with that as a general idea, clockwise rotation regions correspond to positive curl. Counterclockwise rotation regions correspond to negative curl, and then no rotation corresponds to zero curl. In the next video I'm gonna start going through what this means in terms of the underlying function defining the vector field and how we can start looking at the partial differential information of that function to quantify this intuition of fluid rotation. And what's neat is that it's not just about fluid rotation. If you have vector fields in other context and you just imagine that they represent a fluid, even though they don't, this idea rotation and curling actually has certain importance in ways that you totally wouldn't expect. The gradient turns out to relate to the curl, even though you wouldn't necessarily think the grading has something to do with fluid rotation. In electromagnetism, this idea of fluid rotation has a certain importance, even though fluids aren't actually involved. So, it's more general than just the representation that we have here, but it's a very strong visual to have in your mind as you study vector fields.",Curl,Khan Academy (English - CBSE India Curriculum) >> Math >> Multivariable calculus >> Derivatives of multivariable functions >> Curl,curl is a special version of the derivative for vector fields.  it can be nicely interpreted in terms of rotation in fluid flow.. this is the topic tree khan academy (english - cbse india curriculum) >> math >> multivariable calculus >> derivatives of multivariable functions >> curl,video

what about up here at the top where you have clockwise rotation? now there, if you imagine taking the fingers of your right hand and curling them around that direction of rotation your thumb is gonna be pointing straight down. it'll be kind of in the negative z-direction, and we see that with this vector field here. where below that circle, below that point, you have vectors pointing straight down indicating that that's the direction of rotation in that region. so if you do this at every single point and you kind of get an understanding of what the rotation is at every point and assign a vector this is the field that you're gonna get. and let's go ahead and describe that with an actual, with a function. because we know how to compute the two-d curl at this point. you see if this whole thing, if we give names to the two different component functions as p and q then the curl, the two-d curl of this guy, two-d curl of the vector field v has a function of x and y what it equals is the partial derivative of that second component with respect to x. so the partial of q with respect to x minus the partial derivative of that first component with respect to y. so minus partial of p with respect to y. and what we get when we do that, the partial of q with respect to x so we take the partial derivative of this with respect to x, that just looks like a derivative since there's only x's in there, and you get three x squared minus nine. and i actually did this, there's another video where this is the example that i do, when you take this second derivative of p with respect to y, you're taking the derivative of this top part with respect to y and that's three y squared minus nine. and what you can do is you can say, this minus nine cancels out with that, you know minus minus nine. so these guys cancel, and what you ultimately get is three x squared plus three y squared. now what does this mean for the vector field that we see here? because this, this is a scale of valued quantity and yet the vector field that i'm showing, with all these blue vectors indicating rotation, these are vectors. and because the rotation is happening purely in the x-y plane, which is perpendicular to the z-axis, all of these vectors purely have a z-component. so what you might say is that the curl, and i'm not gonna say two-d curl, but actual curl of v of v as a function of x and y is a, it's not a scale or value, but it's a vector and it's gonna be a vector that describes these blue ones in the pure z-direction. and since they're in the pure z-direction the x and y components are zero. but that last component is the formula that we found that describes the magnitude of the curl. three x squared minus three y squared, and this, let's see kinda running out of room, this here you can think of as kind of a prototype to three-dimensional curl. because really, this vector field v, is not quite a three-dimensional vector field is it? it only lives in the x-y plane, it only take in x and y's input points. so what we wanna do is start extending this to say, how can you make this look like a three-dimensional vector field and still kind of understand the rotation as a three-dimensional vector quantity? and that's what i'm gonna continue doing in the next video.. the title of the content is  curl intuition, part ","- [Voiceover] Hello, everyone. So I'm gonna start talking about three-dimensional curl. And to do that, I'm gonna start off by taking the two-dimensional example that I very first used when I was introducing the intuition. You know I talked about fluid flow and I animated it here where with this particular vector field you see a certain counter-clockwise rotation on the right and a clockwise rotation on the top. So I'm gonna take that vector field which hopefully we have a little bit of an intuition for and I'm gonna plop it into three-dimensional space on the x-y plane. So if I just take that whole vector field and I copy it onto the x-y plane here's how it looks. And the vector spacing might be a little bit different, the choice of what subsample of points to use in displaying vectors might be a little bit different but this is the same field, and it's actually worth writing out how it's defined in two-dimensions. This guy is a function of x and y, so it's a vector field function of x and y and what it's components are. Now the first component is y cubed minus nine y and then the next one is x cubed minus nine x. So now if I look at this guy and I say let's start thinking about the fluid rotation associated with it, because it's in three-dimensions it's natural to describe that rotation, not just with a number at each point, you know with a scale or value like the two-dimensional curl gives us, but instead to assign a vector to each one. And when you do that, when you associate a vector to each different point in space according to the fluid rotation that would be happening there, you get something that looks like this. Now this is kind of complicated because there's two different vector fields going on. One of them, all the vectors are perpendicular to the x-y plane. So let's just kind of take it piece by piece and see if we can understand it. So I've got four different circled regions here and one of them is this one on the right where there's counter-clockwise rotation happening. And if you think to your right hand rule, I'm gonna go ahead and bring in the picture of the right hand rule here, where you imagine curling your fingers around that direction of rotation, in the fingers of your right hand, then you stick out your thumb, the direction your thumb is pointing would be the direction of vectors that describe that rotation. So if we do that here and if we you know, you imagine curling your right fingers around there and sticking up your thumb you're gonna get vectors that point in the positive z-direction. So this is why in that region you have vectors pointing up, positively in the z-direction, they're telling you that as you view this x-y plane from above there's counter-clockwise rotation. But then what about at a different point? What about up here at the top where you have clockwise rotation? Now there, if you imagine taking the fingers of your right hand and curling them around that direction of rotation your thumb is gonna be pointing straight down. It'll be kind of in the negative z-direction, and we see that with this vector field here. Where below that circle, below that point, you have vectors pointing straight down indicating that that's the direction of rotation in that region. So if you do this at every single point and you kind of get an understanding of what the rotation is at every point and assign a vector this is the field that you're gonna get. And let's go ahead and describe that with an actual, with a function. Because we know how to compute the two-D curl at this point. You see if this whole thing, if we give names to the two different component functions as P and Q then the curl, the two-D curl of this guy, two-D curl of the vector field v has a function of x and y what it equals is the partial derivative of that second component with respect to x. So the partial of q with respect to x minus the partial derivative of that first component with respect to y. So minus partial of p with respect to y. And what we get when we do that, the partial of q with respect to x So we take the partial derivative of this with respect to x, that just looks like a derivative since there's only x's in there, and you get three x squared minus nine. And I actually did this, there's another video where this is the example that I do, when you take this second derivative of p with respect to y, you're taking the derivative of this top part with respect to y and that's three y squared minus nine. And what you can do is you can say, this minus nine cancels out with that, you know minus minus nine. So these guys cancel, and what you ultimately get is three x squared plus three y squared. Now what does this mean for the vector field that we see here? Because this, this is a scale of valued quantity and yet the vector field that I'm showing, with all these blue vectors indicating rotation, these are vectors. And because the rotation is happening purely in the x-y plane, which is perpendicular to the z-axis, all of these vectors purely have a z-component. So what you might say is that the curl, and I'm not gonna say two-D curl, but actual curl of v of v as a function of x and y is a, it's not a scale or value, but it's a vector and it's gonna be a vector that describes these blue ones in the pure z-direction. And since they're in the pure z-direction the x and y components are zero. But that last component is the formula that we found that describes the magnitude of the curl. Three x squared minus three y squared, and this, let's see kinda running out of room, this here you can think of as kind of a prototype to three-dimensional curl. Because really, this vector field v, is not quite a three-dimensional vector field is it? It only lives in the x-y plane, it only take in x and y's input points. So what we wanna do is start extending this to say, how can you make this look like a three-dimensional vector field and still kind of understand the rotation as a three-dimensional vector quantity? And that's what I'm gonna continue doing in the next video.",Curl,Khan Academy (English - CBSE India Curriculum) >> Math >> Multivariable calculus >> Derivatives of multivariable functions >> Curl,curl is a special version of the derivative for vector fields.  it can be nicely interpreted in terms of rotation in fluid flow.. this is the topic tree khan academy (english - cbse india curriculum) >> math >> multivariable calculus >> derivatives of multivariable functions >> curl,video
84,t_e6191e4a8dd8,c_cec28c86f4b2,0.9,0.9,c_cec28c86f4b2,"3d curl intuition, part 2","continuing the intuition for how three-dimensional curl represents rotation in three-dimensional fluid flow.  . - [voiceover] so where we left off, i had this two-dimensional vector field v, and i have it pictured here as kind of a yellow vector field and i just stuck it in three dimensions in kind of an awkward way where i put it on the xy plane and said pretend this is in three dimensions. and then when you describe the rotation, around each point what we were familiar with is  curl, that's where you get this vector field, it's not quite a  vector field because you're only assigning points on the xy plane to three dimensional vectors, rather than every point in space to a vector, but we're getting there. so here let's actually extend this to a fully three dimensional vector field, and first of all let me just kind of clear up the board from the computations we did in the last part. and as i do that kind of start thinking about how you might want to extend the vector field that i have here that's pretty much two dimensional into three dimensions. and one idea you might, we'll kind of get rid of the circles and the plane, is to take this vector field and then just kind of copy it to different slices. so, you might get something kind of like this. and then, i've drawn each slice a little bit sparser than the original one, so technically that original one if you look on the xy plane i've pictured many more vectors, but it's really the same vector field, and all i've done here is said at every slice in space, just copy that same vector field. so if you look from above, you can maybe see how really it's just the same vector field kind of copied a bunch, and if you look at it each slice, you know in the same way that in the xy plane, you've got this vector field sitting on the slice, every other part of space will have that. and even though there's only what, like six or seven slices displayed here, in principal you're thinking that every one of those infinitely many slices of space has a copy of this vector field. and in a formula, what does that mean? well what it means is what it means is that we're taking not just x and y as input points, but we're gonna start taking z in as well. so if i go, i'm gonna say that z is an input point as well. and i want to be considering these as vectors in three dimensions, so rather than just saying that that it's got x and y components, i'm gonna pretend like it has a z component that just happens to be zero for this case. and the fact that you have a z in the input, but the output doesn't depend on the z, corresponds to the fact that all the slices are the same, as you change the z direction the vectors won't change at all, they're just carbon copies of each other. and the fact this output has a z component, but it just happens to be zero is what corresponds to the fact that it's very flat looking, you know, none of them point up or down in the z direction, they're all purely x and y. so, as three dimensional vector fields go, this one is only barely a three dimensional vector field, it's kind of phoning it in as far as three dimensional vector fields are concerned, but it'll be quite good for our example here, because now if we start thinking of this as representing a three dimensional fluid flow, so now rather than just kind of the fluid flow like the one i have pictured over here, where you've got water molecules moving in two dimensions and it's very easy to understand clockwise rotation, counter clockwise rotation, things like that, whereas over here it's a very kind of chaotic three dimensional fluid flow, but because it's so flat if you view it from above it's still loosely the same just kind of counter clockwise over here on the right, and clockwise like there above, so if i were to draw like a column, you could think of this column as being, having a tornado of fluid flow, right, where it's, everything is kind of rotating together in that same direction. so if you were to assign a vector to each point in space to describe the kind of rotation happening around each one of those points in space, you would expect that those inside this column, inside this sort of counter clockwise rotating tornado, and i say counter clockwise, but if we viewed it from below it would look clockwise, so that's the tricky part about three dimensions and why we need to describe it with vectors, but you expect these using your right hand rule, where you curl the fingers of your right hand around the direction of rotation here, you would expect vectors that point up in the z direction, the positive z direction, and if i do that, if i show what all of the rotation vectors look like, you'll get this, and maybe this is kind of a mess because there's a lot of things on the screen at this point. so for the moment i'll kind of remove that original vector field and remove the xy plane, and just kind of focus on this new vector field that i have pictured here. inside that column where we have that tornado rotation i was describing, all of the vectors point in the positive z direction, but if we were to view it elsewhere, like over in this region, those are pointing in the negative z direction, and if you stick your thumb in the direction of all of these vectors in the negative z direction, that tells you the direction of, that tells you how the fluid, maybe you're thinking of it as air kind of rushing about the room, how that fluid rotates it in three dimensions. so what curl is gonna do, here i'll kind of clear things up, i have the formula from last time, that hopefully hasn't looked too in the way while i've been doing this, that described curl for a two dimensional vector field if we imagine that's not just taking x and y as its inputs because it's a three dimensional vector field, but if we imagine it taking x, y and z, so it's a proper three dimensional vector field, the output is gonna tell you at every point in space what the rotation that corresponds to that point is. and in the next video i'm gonna give you the formula and tell you how you actually compute this curl given an arbitrary function, but for right now we're just getting the visual intuition, we're just trying to understand what it is that curl is going to represent. and in this vector field, this one that was just kind of copies of a  put above, it's almost contrived because all of the rotation happens in these perfect tornado-like patters that doesn't really change as you move up and down in the xy direction, but more generally you might have a more complicated looking vector field, so i'll go ahead and finally erase this since it's been a little bit in the way for a while, and erase this guy too, and if you think about just arbitrary three dimensional vector fields, like let's say this one that i have here, so i don't know about you, but for me it's really hard to think about the fluid flow associated with this, i have a vague notion in my mind that okay, like fluid is flowing out from this corner and kind of flowing in here, but it's very hard to think about it all at once, and certainly if you start talking about rotation, it's hard to look at a given point and say, oh yeah there's gonna be a general fluid rotation in some certain way and i can give you the vector for that. but as a more loose and vague idea, i can say, okay, given that there's some kind of crazy air current fluid flow happening around here, i can maybe understand that at a specific point, you're gonna have some kind of rotation, and here i'll picture it as if there's like a ball or a globe sitting there in space, and maybe you're imagining your new vector field and saying what kind of rotation is it kind of induce in that ball that's just floating there in space? maybe you're imagining this as like a tennis ball that you're sort of holding in place in space using magnets or magic or something like that, and you're letting the wind sort of freely rotate it, and you're wondering what direction it tends to rotate, and then when it does and when you have this rotation, you can describe that  rotation with some kind of vector, and in this case it would be a vector that points out in that direction because we're kind of curling our fingers, curling our right hand fingers over in that direction, and if you don't understand how we describe  rotation with a vector, i have a video on that, maybe go back and check out that video, but the idea here is that when you have some sort of crazy fluid flow that's induced by some sort of vector field, and you do this at every point and say, hey what's the rotation at every single point, that's gonna give you the curl, that is what the curl of a three dimensional vector field is trying to represent. and if this feels confusing, if this feels like something that's hard to wrap your mind around, don't worry we've been there,  curl is one of the most complicated things in multivariable calculus that we have to describe. but i think the key to understanding it is to just kind of patiently think through and take the time to think about what  curl is instead of thinking about how you extend that to three dimensions and slowly say, okay, okay, i kind of get it, tornados of rotation, that sort of makes sense, and if you understand how to represent three dimensional rotation around a single point with a vector, then understanding three dimensional curl comes down to thinking about doing that at every single point in space according to whatever rotation the wind flow around that point would induce. like i said, it is complicated, and it's okay if it doesn't sink the first time, it certainly took me awhile to really wrap my head around this  curl idea, and with that i'll see you next video.. the title of the content is  curl intuition, part ","- [Voiceover] So where we left off, I had this two-dimensional vector field V, and I have it pictured here as kind of a yellow vector field and I just stuck it in three dimensions in kind of an awkward way where I put it on the XY plane and said pretend this is in three dimensions. And then when you describe the rotation, around each point what we were familiar with is 2D curl, that's where you get this vector field, it's not quite a 3D vector field because you're only assigning points on the XY plane to three dimensional vectors, rather than every point in space to a vector, but we're getting there. So here let's actually extend this to a fully three dimensional vector field, and first of all let me just kind of clear up the board from the computations we did in the last part. And as I do that kind of start thinking about how you might want to extend the vector field that I have here that's pretty much two dimensional into three dimensions.

And even though there's only what, like six or seven slices displayed here, in principal you're thinking that every one of those infinitely many slices of space has a copy of this vector field. And in a formula, what does that mean? Well what it means is what it means is that we're taking not just X and Y as input points, But we're gonna start taking Z in as well. So if I go, I'm gonna say that Z is an input point as well. And I want to be considering these as vectors in three dimensions, so rather than just saying that that it's got X and Y components, I'm gonna pretend like it has a Z component that just happens to be zero for this case. And the fact that you have a Z in the input, but the output doesn't depend on the Z, corresponds to the fact that all the slices are the same, as you change the Z direction the vectors won't change at all, they're just carbon copies of each other. And the fact this output has a Z component, but it just happens to be zero is what corresponds to the fact that it's very flat looking, you know, none of them point up or down in the Z direction, they're all purely X and Y. So, as three dimensional vector fields go, this one is only barely a three dimensional vector field, it's kind of phoning it in as far as three dimensional vector fields are concerned, but it'll be quite good for our example here, because now if we start thinking of this as representing a three dimensional fluid flow, so now rather than just kind of the fluid flow like the one I have pictured over here, where you've got water molecules moving in two dimensions and it's very easy to understand clockwise rotation, counter clockwise rotation, things like that, whereas over here it's a very kind of chaotic three dimensional fluid flow, but because it's so flat if you view it from above it's still loosely the same just kind of counter clockwise over here on the right, and clockwise like there above, so if I were to draw like a column, you could think of this column as being, having a tornado of fluid flow, right, where it's, everything is kind of rotating together in that same direction. So if you were to assign a vector to each point in space to describe the kind of rotation happening around each one of those points in space, you would expect that those inside this column, inside this sort of counter clockwise rotating tornado, and I say counter clockwise, but if we viewed it from below it would look clockwise, so that's the tricky part about three dimensions and why we need to describe it with vectors, but you expect these using your right hand rule, where you curl the fingers of your right hand around the direction of rotation here, you would expect vectors that point up in the Z direction, the positive Z direction, and if I do that, if I show what all of the rotation vectors look like, you'll get this, and maybe this is kind of a mess because there's a lot of things on the screen at this point. So for the moment I'll kind of remove that original vector field and remove the XY plane, and just kind of focus on this new vector field that I have pictured here. Inside that column where we have that tornado rotation I was describing, all of the vectors point in the positive Z direction, but if we were to view it elsewhere, like over in this region, those are pointing in the negative Z direction, and if you stick your thumb in the direction of all of these vectors in the negative Z direction, that tells you the direction of, that tells you how the fluid, maybe you're thinking of it as air kind of rushing about the room, how that fluid rotates it in three dimensions. So what curl is gonna do, here I'll kind of clear things up, I have the formula from last time, that hopefully hasn't looked too in the way while I've been doing this, that described curl for a two dimensional vector field if we imagine that's not just taking X and Y as its inputs because it's a three dimensional vector field, but if we imagine it taking X, Y and Z, so it's a proper three dimensional vector field, the output is gonna tell you at every point in space what the rotation that corresponds to that point is. And in the next video I'm gonna give you the formula and tell you how you actually compute this curl given an arbitrary function, but for right now we're just getting the visual intuition, we're just trying to understand what it is that curl is going to represent. And in this vector field, this one that was just kind of copies of a 2D put above, it's almost contrived because all of the rotation happens in these perfect tornado-like patters that doesn't really change as you move up and down in the XY direction, but more generally you might have a more complicated looking vector field, so I'll go ahead and finally erase this since it's been a little bit in the way for a while, and erase this guy too, and if you think about just arbitrary three dimensional vector fields, like let's say this one that I have here, so I don't know about you, but for me it's really hard to think about the fluid flow associated with this, I have a vague notion in my mind that okay, like fluid is flowing out from this corner and kind of flowing in here, but it's very hard to think about it all at once, and certainly if you start talking about rotation, it's hard to look at a given point and say, oh yeah there's gonna be a general fluid rotation in some certain way and I can give you the vector for that.

But I think the key to understanding it is to just kind of patiently think through and take the time to think about what 2D curl is instead of thinking about how you extend that to three dimensions and slowly say, okay, okay, I kind of get it, tornados of rotation, that sort of makes sense, and if you understand how to represent three dimensional rotation around a single point with a vector, then understanding three dimensional curl comes down to thinking about doing that at every single point in space according to whatever rotation the wind flow around that point would induce. Like I said, it is complicated, and it's okay if it doesn't sink the first time, it certainly took me awhile to really wrap my head around this 3D curl idea, and with that I'll see you next video.",Curl,Khan Academy (English - CBSE India Curriculum) >> Math >> Multivariable calculus >> Derivatives of multivariable functions >> Curl,curl is a special version of the derivative for vector fields.  it can be nicely interpreted in terms of rotation in fluid flow.. this is the topic tree khan academy (english - cbse india curriculum) >> math >> multivariable calculus >> derivatives of multivariable functions >> curl,video

so what you do, as i mentioned in the last video, is you imagine taking this del operator and taking the cross product between that and your vector valued function. and what that means when you expand it is that del operator, you just kinda fill it with partial differential operators, you could say, but really it's just the symbol partial partial x, partial partial y, partial partial z. and these are things that are just waiting to take in some kind of function. so we're gonna take the cross product between that and the function that we have defined here. so i'm gonna just actually copy it over, copy it over here. and a little residue. and to compute this cross product, we take a certain determinant. so i'm gonna write over here determinant, and it's gonna be of a three-by-three matrix, but really it's kinda like a quote-unquote matrix, because each component has something funky. so the top row, just like we would have with any other cross product that we're computing is gonna have i, j, and k, these unit vectors in three-dimensional space. and the second row here is gonna have all of these partial differential operators, since that's the first vector in our cross product. so that's partial partial x, partial partial y, and again, all of these are just kind of waiting to be given a function that they can take the derivative of. and then that third row is gonna be the functions that we have. so the first component here is xy, the second component is cosine of z, cosine of z, and then that final component is z squared plus y. z squared plus y. now let's all get some room here, maybe make it more visible. so this is the determinant we need to compute. and this is gonna be broken up into three different parts. the first one, we take this top part, i, and multiply it by the determinant of this sub-matrix. so when we do that, this sub-determinant, we're taking partial derivative with respect to y of z squared plus y. now as far as y is concerned, z looks like a constant. so z squared is a constant, and the partial derivative of this entire guy is just one. so that'll look like one. and then we're subtracting off the partial derivative with respect to z of cosine of z, and that just looks the same as a derivative of cosine z, which is negative sine, so that's negative sine of z. so that's the first part. and then as the next part, we're gonna take j, but we're subtracting, 'cause you're always kinda thinking plus, minus, plus, when you're doing these determinants. so we're gonna subtract off j, multiplied by its own little sub-determinant, and this time the sub-determinant is gonna involve the two columns that it's not part of. so you're imagining this first column and this second column as being part of a matrix. so the first thing you do is you take this partial derivative with respect to x of z squared plus y. well no xs show up there, right? that's z squared and y. each look like constants as far as x is concerned. so that's zero. then we take the partial with respect to z of x times y. and again, there's no z that shows up there, so that's also zero, so we're kinda subtracting off zero. and then finally, we're adding this last component. we're gonna add that last component, k, multiplied by the determinant of this sub-matrix of the columns that it's not part of. so this involves partial derivative with respect to x of cosine z. well no xs show up there, so that's just zero. so that's just a zero. and then we're subtracting off the partial with respect to y of x times y. well x looks like a constant, y looks like the variable, so that partial derivative is just x. so we're subtracting off x. which means if we simplify this, so the curl of our vector field, curl of our vector field as a whole, as this function of x, y, and z, is equal to, and that first component, the i component, we've got one minus negative sine of z, so minus minus sine of z. that's one plus sine of z. and then the j component, we're subtracting off, but it's zero. usually if you're subtracting off, you'd have to make sure to remember to flip those, but both of those are zero, so the entire j component here, or the y component of the output, is zero. and then finally, the k component is zero minus x, so that entire thing is just negative x. and that's the curl of the function. and in general, that's how you do it. you would take a look at the way that your function is defined in each component there, and imaging taking the cross product between this del symbol, this partial partial x, partial partial y, partial partial z, and you take the cross product between that and your function, and it involves taking six different partial derivatives. and mainly it's a matter of bookkeeping to make sure you do it right. and you'll end up with something like this.. the title of the content is  curl computation example","- [Voiceover] So let's go ahead and work through an actual curl computation. Let's say our vector valued function V, which is a function of X, Y, and Z, this is gonna be three-dimensional, is defined by the functions, I don't know, let's say the first component is X times Y. The second one is cosine of Z, and then the last component is Z squared plus Y. Let's say. So if you take this guy, how do you compute the curl of that vector valued function? So what you do, as I mentioned in the last video, is you imagine taking this del operator and taking the cross product between that and your vector valued function. And what that means when you expand it is that del operator, you just kinda fill it with partial differential operators, you could say, but really it's just the symbol partial partial X, partial partial Y, partial partial Z. And these are things that are just waiting to take in some kind of function. So we're gonna take the cross product between that and the function that we have defined here. So I'm gonna just actually copy it over, copy it over here. And a little residue. And to compute this cross product, we take a certain determinant. So I'm gonna write over here determinant, and it's gonna be of a three-by-three matrix, but really it's kinda like a quote-unquote matrix, because each component has something funky. So the top row, just like we would have with any other cross product that we're computing is gonna have i, j, and k, these unit vectors in three-dimensional space. And the second row here is gonna have all of these partial differential operators, since that's the first vector in our cross product. So that's partial partial X, partial partial Y, and again, all of these are just kind of waiting to be given a function that they can take the derivative of. And then that third row is gonna be the functions that we have. So the first component here is XY, the second component is cosine of Z, cosine of Z, and then that final component is Z squared plus Y. Z squared plus Y. Now let's all get some room here, maybe make it more visible. So this is the determinant we need to compute. And this is gonna be broken up into three different parts. The first one, we take this top part, i, and multiply it by the determinant of this sub-matrix. So when we do that, this sub-determinant, we're taking partial derivative with respect to Y of Z squared plus Y. Now as far as Y is concerned, Z looks like a constant. So Z squared is a constant, and the partial derivative of this entire guy is just one. So that'll look like one. And then we're subtracting off the partial derivative with respect to Z of cosine of Z, and that just looks the same as a derivative of cosine Z, which is negative sine, so that's negative sine of Z. So that's the first part. And then as the next part, we're gonna take j, but we're subtracting, 'cause you're always kinda thinking plus, minus, plus, when you're doing these determinants. So we're gonna subtract off j, multiplied by its own little sub-determinant, and this time the sub-determinant is gonna involve the two columns that it's not part of. So you're imagining this first column and this second column as being part of a matrix. So the first thing you do is you take this partial derivative with respect to X of Z squared plus Y. Well no Xs show up there, right? That's Z squared and Y. Each look like constants as far as X is concerned. So that's zero. Then we take the partial with respect to Z of X times Y. And again, there's no Z that shows up there, so that's also zero, so we're kinda subtracting off zero. And then finally, we're adding this last component. We're gonna add that last component, k, multiplied by the determinant of this sub-matrix of the columns that it's not part of. So this involves partial derivative with respect to X of cosine Z. Well no Xs show up there, so that's just zero. So that's just a zero. And then we're subtracting off the partial with respect to Y of X times Y. Well X looks like a constant, Y looks like the variable, so that partial derivative is just X. So we're subtracting off X. Which means if we simplify this, so the curl of our vector field, curl of our vector field as a whole, as this function of X, Y, and Z, is equal to, and that first component, the i component, we've got one minus negative sine of Z, so minus minus sine of Z. That's one plus sine of Z. And then the j component, we're subtracting off, but it's zero. Usually if you're subtracting off, you'd have to make sure to remember to flip those, but both of those are zero, so the entire j component here, or the Y component of the output, is zero. And then finally, the k component is zero minus X, so that entire thing is just negative X. And that's the curl of the function. And in general, that's how you do it. You would take a look at the way that your function is defined in each component there, and imaging taking the cross product between this del symbol, this partial partial X, partial partial Y, partial partial Z, and you take the cross product between that and your function, and it involves taking six different partial derivatives.

86,t_e6191e4a8dd8,c_b740ec0ebacd,0.9,0.9,c_b740ec0ebacd,2d curl example,"a worked example of computing and interpreting two-dimensional curl.  . - [voiceover] so let's compute the two dimensional curl of a vector field. the one i have in mind will have an x component of, let's see not nine. but y cubed minus nine times y and then the y component will be x cubed minus nine times x. you can kind see i'm just a sucker for symmetry when i choose examples. when i showed in the last video how the two dimensional curl, the  curl of a vector field, of a vector field v which is a function of x and y, is equal to the partial derivative of q, that second component, with respect to x minus the partial derivative of p that first component, with respect to y. and i went through the reasoning for why this is true but just real quick kinda the in the nutshell here, this partial q, partial x is because of as you move from left to right vectors tend to go from having a small or even negative y component to a positive y component, that corresponds to counter clockwise rotation. and similarly this dp, dy is because if vectors as you move up and down as you kind of increase the y value go from being positive to zero to negative or if they're decreasing that also corresponds to counter clockwise rotation. so taking the negative of that will tell you whether or not changes in the y direction around your point correspond with counter clockwise rotation. so in this particular case when we start evaluating that, we start by looking at partial of q with respect to x. so we're looking at the second component and taking its partial derivative with respect to x and in this case, nothing but x's show up so it's just like taking its derivative and you get three x squared minus nine. three x squared minus nine, and that's the first part. then we subtract off whatever the partial derivative of p with respect to y is, so we go up here and it's entirely in terms of y and trying to do the symmetry we're just taking the same calculation, three y squared that derivative of y cubed minus nine. so this right here is our two dimensional curl. and lets go ahead and interpret what this means. and in fact this vector field that i showed you is exactly the one that i used when i was kind of animating the intuition behind curl to start off with, where i had these specific parts where there is positive curl here and here but negative curl up in these clockwise rotating areas. so we can actually see why that's the case here and why i chose this specific function for something that'll have lots of good curl examples. cause if we look over in that region where there should be positive curl, that's where x is equal to three and y is equal to zero. so i go over here and say if x is equal to three, and y is equal to zero, this whole formula becomes let's see, three times three squared so, three times three squared minus nine, minus nine and then minus the quantity now we're plugging in y here so that's three times y squared is just zero cause y is equal to zero, minus nine. minus nine and so this part is , that's three times nine is  minus nine gives us . and then we're subtracting off a negative nine so that's actually plus nine so this whole thing is , it's actually quite positive, so this is a positive number and that's why when we go over here and we're looking at the fluid flow, you have a counter clockwise rotation in that region. whereas, let's say we did all of this but instead of x equals three and y equals zero, we looked at x is equal to zero and y is equal to three. so in that case, we would instead, so x equals zero, y equals three, let's take a look at where that is. x is zero, and then y the tick mark's here are each one half so y equals three is right here, it's in that clockwise rotation area so if i kind of play this, we got the clockwise rotation, we're expecting a negative value. now let's see if that's what we get. we go over here and i'm gonna evaluate this whole function again. how about plugging in zero for x so this is three times zero times zero minus nine. and then we're subtracting off three times y squared so that's three times three squared. three squared minus nine. and this whole part is zero minus nine so that becomes negative nine and over here we're subtracting off  minus nine which is  so we're subtracting off , so the whole thing equals negative . so maybe i should say that equals negative . so because this is negative that's what corresponds to the clockwise rotation that we have going on in that region. and if you went and you plugged in a bunch of different points like you could perhaps see how if you plug in zero for x and zero for y, those nines cancel out which is why over here there's no general rotation around the origin when x and y are both equal to zero. and you can understand that every single point and the general rotation around every single point just by taking this formula that we found for  curl, and plugging in the corresponding values of x and y. so it's actually a very powerful tool cause you would think that's a very complicated thing to figure out right, that if i give you this pretty complicated fluid flow and say hey i want you to figure out a number that'll tell me the general direction and strength of rotation around each point, that's a lot of information so it's nice just to have a small compact formula.. the title of the content is  curl example","- [Voiceover] So let's compute the two dimensional curl of a vector field.

And I went through the reasoning for why this is true but just real quick kinda the in the nutshell here, this partial q, partial x is because of as you move from left to right vectors tend to go from having a small or even negative y component to a positive y component, that corresponds to counter clockwise rotation.

And then we're subtracting off a negative nine so that's actually plus nine so this whole thing is 27, it's actually quite positive, so this is a positive number and that's why when we go over here and we're looking at the fluid flow, you have a counter clockwise rotation in that region.

87,t_e6191e4a8dd8,c_1e256d94701f,0.9,0.9,c_1e256d94701f,"3d curl formula, part 1","how to compute a three-dimensional curl, imagined as a cross product of sorts.  . - [voiceover] so i've spent a couple videos laying down the foundation for what three-dimensional curl is trying to represent, and here i'm going to go ahead and talk about how you actually compute it. three-d curl is the kind of thing that you take with regards to a three-dimensional vector field. so something that takes in a three-dimensional point as its input, and then it's going to output a three-dimensional vector. it's common to write the component functions as p, q, and r. each one of these is a scale or valued function that takes in a three-dimensional point, and just outputs a number. so, it'll be that same three-d point with the coordinates x, y, and z. so when you have a three-dimensional vector field like this, the image you might have in mind would be something like this, where every point in three-dimensional space has a vector attached to it. and you know, when you actually look at it, there's quite a lot going on, but in principle, all that's really happening is that each point in space is associated with a vector. the point in space is the input and the vector is the output. you're just gluing them together. naturally, between the three dimensions of the input and the three dimensions of the output, we have six dimensions going on, the picture that you're looking at becomes quite messy. so, the question is, how do you compute this curl value that i've been talking about. curl of your vector value function. just as a quick reminder, what this is supposed to be, is you're going to have some kind of fluid flow induced by this vector field, where you're imagining air flowing along each vector. what you want is a function that tells you at any given point, what is the rotation induced by that fluid flow around that point. because rotation is described with a three-dimensional vector, you're expecting this to be vector-valued. it'll be something that equals a vector output. if that doesn't make sense, if that doesn't quite jive, maybe go check out the video on how to represent three-dimensional rotation with a vector. so what you have here is going to be something that takes as its input, x, y, and z. it takes a three-dimensional point, and what it outputs is a vector describing rotation, and there's actually another notation that's quite, quite helpful when it comes to computing this. you take nabla, that upside-down triangle we used in divergence and gradient, and you imagine taking the cross-product between that and your vector v. as a reminder, this nabla, you imagine it as if it's a vector containing partial differential operators. that's the kind of thing where, when you say it out loud, it sounds kinda fancy, a vector full of partial differential operators, but all it really means is i'm just going to write a bunch of symbols. this partial partial x is something that wants to take in a multi-variable function, and tell you its partial derivative. strictly speaking, this doesn't really make sense, like, hey, how can a vector contain these partial differential operators? but as a series of symbolic movements, it's actually quite helpful, because when you're multiplying these guys by a thing, it's not really multiplication. you're really going to be giving it some kind of multi-variable function, like p, q, or r, the component functions of our vector field, and evaluating it. so just as a warm-up for how to do this, let's see what this looks like in the case of two dimensions, where we already know the formula for two-dimensional curl. what that would look like, is you have a smaller, more two-dimensional, just partial partial x, partial partial y, del operator. you're going to take the cross-product between that and a two-dimensional vector that's just the component functions p and q. in this case, p and q would be just functions of x and y. so i'm kind of overloading notation right, over here i have a two-dimensional vector field that i'm saying, p and y are scale or value functions with a two-dimensional input, but over here i'm also using p and q to represent ones with a three-dimensional input. so you should think of these as separate, but it's common to use the same names. this is going to illustrate the broader, more complicated point. when you compute something like this, the cross-product, you typically think of it as taking these diagonal components and multiplying them, so that would be your partial partial x, ""multiplied"" with q, which really means you're taking the partial derivative of q with respect to x. then you subtract off this diagonal component here, oh sorry, this should be a y. this should be partial partial y. sorry about that. you need partial partial y of p, and that's what you're subtracting off. so partial partial y of p, just the partial derivative of that p function with respect to y. hopefully this is something you recognize. this is the two-dimensional curl. it's something we got an intuition for, i want it to be more than just a formula, but hopefully this is kind of reassuring that when you take that del operator, that nabla symbol, and cross-product with the vector valued function itself, it gives you a sense of curl. now when we do this in the three-dimensional case, we're going to take a three-dimensional cross-product between this three-dimensional vectorish thing and this three-dimensional function. if you're not terribly comfortable with the cross-product, how to compute it or how to interpret it and things like that, now would probably be a good time to go find the videos that sal does on this and build up that intuition for what a cross-product actually is and how to compute it. because at this point, i'm going to assume that you know how to compute it because we're doing it in kind of an absurd context of partial differential operators and functions, so it's important to have that foundation. the way you compute a thing like this, is you construct a determinant. i'm going to go down here. determinant of a certain  matrix. the top row of that is all of the unit vectors in various directions of three-dimensional space. so these i, j, and k guys, i represents the unit vector in the x direction, so that would be i is equal to, x component is one but then the other components are zero. then similarly, j and k represent the unit vectors in the y and z direction, and again, if that doesn't quite make sense, why i'm putting them up there or what we're about to do, maybe check out that cross-product video. so we put those in the top rows as vectors. this is the trick to computing the cross-product, because again, what does it mean to put a vector inside a matrix, but it's a notational trick. then we're going to take the first vector that we're doing the cross-product with, and put its components in the next row. what that would look like, is the next row has a partial partial y, no sorry, god i keep messing up here, that's an x, you do whatever the first component is first, and then the second component second, and the third component, the z, partial z. don't know why i'm making that little mistake. for the last row, you put in the second vector, which is in this case, is vector value function p, q, and r. p, which is a multi-variable function, q, and r. first, it's worth stepping back and looking at this. this is kind of an absurd thing. usually when we talk about matrices and taking the determinant, all of the components are numbers because you're multiplying numbers together. but here, we've got a notational trick layered on top of a notational trick, so that one of the rows is vectors, one of the rows is partial differential operators, and then the last one, each one of these is a multi-variable function. so it seems like this absurd, convoluted, as far away from a matrix full of numbers thing as you can get, but it's actually very helpful for computation. if you go through the process of computing this determinant and saying, what could that mean, the thing that pops out is going to be the formula for three-dimensional curl. at the risk of having a video that runs too long, i'll call things and end here, but continue going through that operation in the next video.. the title of the content is  curl formula, part ","- [Voiceover] So I've spent a couple videos laying down the foundation for what

And you know, when you actually look at it, there's quite a lot going on, but in principle, all that's really happening is that each point in space is associated with a vector. The point in space is the input and the vector is the output. You're just gluing them together. Naturally, between the three dimensions of the input and the three dimensions of the output, we have six dimensions going on, the picture that you're looking at becomes quite messy. So, the question is, how do you compute this curl value that I've been talking about. Curl of your vector value function. Just as a quick reminder, what this is supposed to be, is you're going to have some kind of fluid flow induced by this vector field, where you're imagining air flowing along each vector. What you want is a function that tells you at any given point, what is the rotation induced by that fluid flow around that point. Because rotation is described with a three-dimensional vector, you're expecting this to be vector-valued. It'll be something that equals a vector output. If that doesn't make sense, if that doesn't quite jive, maybe go check out the video on how to represent three-dimensional rotation with a vector. So what you have here is going to be something that takes as its input, x, y, and z. It takes a three-dimensional point, and what it outputs is a vector describing rotation, and there's actually another notation that's quite, quite helpful when it comes to computing this. You take nabla, that upside-down triangle we used in divergence and gradient, and you imagine taking the cross-product between that and your vector V. As a reminder, this nabla, you imagine it as if it's a vector containing partial differential operators. That's the kind of thing where, when you say it out loud, it sounds kinda fancy, a vector full of partial differential operators, but all it really means is I'm just going to write a bunch of symbols. This partial partial x is something that wants to take in a multi-variable function, and tell you its partial derivative. Strictly speaking, this doesn't really make sense, like, hey, how can a vector contain these partial differential operators? But as a series of symbolic movements, it's actually quite helpful, because when you're multiplying these guys by a thing, it's not really multiplication. You're really going to be giving it some kind of multi-variable function, like P, Q, or R, the component functions of our vector field, and evaluating it. So just as a warm-up for how to do this, let's see what this looks like in the case of two dimensions, where we already know the formula for two-dimensional curl. What that would look like, is you have a smaller, more two-dimensional, just partial partial x, partial partial y, del operator. You're going to take the cross-product between that and a two-dimensional vector that's just the component functions P and Q. In this case, P and Q would be just functions of x and y. So I'm kind of overloading notation right, over here I have a two-dimensional vector field that I'm saying, P and y are scale or value functions with a two-dimensional input, but over here I'm also using P and Q to represent ones with a three-dimensional input. So you should think of these as separate, but it's common to use the same names. This is going to illustrate the broader, more complicated point. When you compute something like this, the cross-product, you typically think of it as taking these diagonal components and multiplying them, so that would be your partial partial x, ""multiplied"" with Q, which really means you're taking the partial derivative of Q with respect to x. Then you subtract off this diagonal component here, oh sorry, this should be a y. This should be partial partial y. Sorry about that. You need partial partial y of P, and that's what you're subtracting off. So partial partial y of P, just the partial derivative of that P function with respect to y. Hopefully this is something you recognize. This is the two-dimensional curl. It's something we got an intuition for, I want it to be more than just a formula, but hopefully this is kind of reassuring that when you take that del operator, that nabla symbol, and cross-product with the vector valued function itself, it gives you a sense of curl. Now when we do this in the three-dimensional case, we're going to take a three-dimensional cross-product between this three-dimensional vectorish thing and this three-dimensional function. If you're not terribly comfortable with the cross-product, how to compute it or how to interpret it and things like that, now would probably be a good time to go find the videos that Sal does on this and build up that intuition for what a cross-product actually is and how to compute it. Because at this point, I'm going to assume that you know how to compute it because we're doing it in kind of an absurd context of partial differential operators and functions, so it's important to have that foundation. The way you compute a thing like this, is you construct a determinant. I'm going to go down here. Determinant of a certain 3x3 matrix. The top row of that is all of the unit vectors in various directions of three-dimensional space. So these I, J, and K guys, I represents the unit vector in the x direction, so that would be I is equal to, x component is one but then the other components are zero. Then similarly, J and K represent the unit vectors in the y and z direction, and again, if that doesn't quite make sense, why I'm putting them up there or what we're about to do, maybe check out that cross-product video. So we put those in the top rows as vectors. This is the trick to computing the cross-product, because again, what does it mean to put a vector inside a matrix, but it's a notational trick. Then we're going to take the first vector that we're doing the cross-product with, and put its components in the next row. What that would look like, is the next row has a partial partial y, no sorry, God I keep messing up here, that's an x, you do whatever the first component is first, and then the second component second, and the third component, the z, partial z. Don't know why I'm making that little mistake. For the last row, you put in the second vector, which is in this case, is vector value function P, Q, and R. P, which is a multi-variable function, Q, and R. First, it's worth stepping back and looking at this. This is kind of an absurd thing. Usually when we talk about matrices and taking the determinant, all of the components are numbers because you're multiplying numbers together. But here, we've got a notational trick layered on top of a notational trick, so that one of the rows is vectors, one of the rows is partial differential operators, and then the last one, each one of these is a multi-variable function. So it seems like this absurd, convoluted, as far away from a matrix full of numbers thing as you can get, but it's actually very helpful for computation. If you go through the process of computing this determinant and saying, what could that mean, the thing that pops out is going to be the formula for three-dimensional curl. At the risk of having a video that runs too long, I'll call things and end here, but continue going through that operation in the next video.",Curl,Khan Academy (English - CBSE India Curriculum) >> Math >> Multivariable calculus >> Derivatives of multivariable functions >> Curl,curl is a special version of the derivative for vector fields.  it can be nicely interpreted in terms of rotation in fluid flow.. this is the topic tree khan academy (english - cbse india curriculum) >> math >> multivariable calculus >> derivatives of multivariable functions >> curl,video

rotation that happens purely in the xz plane is gonna correspond with a rotation vector in the y direction, the direction perpendicular to the x, let's see, so the xz plane over here. and then similarly this first component kind of tells you all the rotation happening in the yz plane and the vectors in the i direction, the x direction of the output, kind of corresponds to rotation in that plane. now when you compute it, you're not always thinking about oh, you know, this corresponds to rotation in that plane and this corresponds to rotation in that plane, you're just kind of computing it to get a formula out, but i think it's kind of nice to recognize that all the intuition that we put into the two-dimensional curl does show up here and another thing i wanna emphasize is this is not a formula to be memorized. i would not, if i were you, try to sit down and memorize this long expression. the only thing that you need to remember, the only thing, is that curl is represented as this del cross v, this nabla symbol cross product with a vector-valued function v, because from there, whatever your components are, you can kind of go through the process that i just did and the more you do it, the quicker it becomes, it's kind of long but it doesn't take that long, and it's certainly much more fault-tolerant than trying to remember something that has as many moving parts as the formula that you see here, and in the next video i'll go through an actual example of that. i'll have functions for p, q, and r and walk through that process in a more concrete context. i'll see you then!. the title of the content is  curl formula, part ","- [Voiceover] So I'm explaining the formula for three-dimensional curl and where we left off, we have this determinant of a three-by-three matrix, which looks absurd because none of the individual components are actual numbers, but nevertheless, I'm about show how when you kind of go through the motions of taking a determinant, you get a vector-valued function that corresponds to the curl. So let me show you what I mean by that. If you're computing the determinant, of the guy that we have pictured there in the upper-right, you start by taking this upper-left component, and then multiplying it by the determinant of the sub-matrix, the sub-matrix whose rows are not the row of I and whose columns are not the row of I. So what that looks like over here, is we're gonna take that unit vector I, and then multiple it by a certain little determinant, and what this sub-determinant involves is multiplying this partial-partial Y by R, which means taking the partial derivative with respect to Y of the multi-variable function R and then subtracting off the partial derivative with respect to Z of Q. So we're subtracting off partial derivative with respect to Z of the multi-variable function Q, and then that, so that's the first thing that we do, and then as a second part, we take this J and we're gonna subtract off, so you're kind of thinking plus, minus, plus, for the elements in this top row, so we're gonna subtract off J, multiplied by another sub-determinant, and then this one is gonna involve, you know, this column that it's not part of and this column that it's not part of, and you imagine those guys as a two-by-two matrix, and its determinant involves taking the partial derivative with respect to X of R, so that's kind of the diagonal, partial-partial X of R, and then subtracting off the partial derivative with respect to Z of P, so partial-partial Z of P, and then that's just two out of three of the things we need to do for our overall determinant, because the last part we're gonna add, we're gonna add that top-right component, K, multiplied by the sub-matrix whose columns involve the column it's not part of and whose rows involve the rows that it's not part of, so K multiplied by the determinant of this guy is going to be, let's see, partial-partial X of Q, so that's partial-partial X of Q minus partial-partial Y of P, so partial derivative with respect to Y of the multi-variable function P, and that entire expression is the three-dimensional curl of the function whose components are P, Q, and R. So here we have our vector function, vector-valued function V whose components are P, Q, and R, and when you go through this whole process of imagining the cross-product between the Del operator, this Nabla symbol, and the vector output P, Q, and R, what you get is this whole expression, and, you know, here we're writing with I, J, K notation, if you're writing it as a column vector, I guess I didn't erase some of these guys, but if you're writing this as a column vector, it would look like saying the curl of your vector valued function V as a function of X, Y, and Z is equal to, and then what I'd put in for this first component would be what's up there, so that would be your partial with respect to Y of R minus partial of Q with respect to Z, so partial of Q with respect to Z, and I won't copy it down for all of the other ones but in principle, you know, you'd kind of, whatever this J component is, and I guess we're subtracting it so you'd subtract there, you'd copy that as the next component and then over here. But often times when you're computing curl, you kinda switch to using this IJK notation. My personal preference, I typically default to column vectors and other people will write in terms of I, J, and K, it doesn't really matter as long as you know how to go back and forth between the two. One really quick thing that I wanna highlight before doing an example of this is that the K-component here, the Z-component of the output, is exactly the two-dimensional curl formula. If you kind of look back to the videos on 2-D curl and what its formula is, that is what we have here. And in fact all the other components kind of look like mirrors of that but you're using slightly different operators and slightly different functions but if you think about rotation that happens purely in the XY plane, just two-dimensional rotation, and how in three dimensions that's described with a vector in the K direction and again, if that doesn't quite seem clear, maybe look back at the video on describing rotation with a three-dimensional vector and the right-hand rule, but vector is pointing in the pure Z direction, describe rotation in the XY plane, and what's happening with these other guys is kind of similar, right? Rotation that happens purely in the XZ plane is gonna correspond with a rotation vector in the Y direction, the direction perpendicular to the X, let's see, so the XZ plane over here. And then similarly this first component kind of tells you all the rotation happening in the YZ plane and the vectors in the I direction, the X direction of the output, kind of corresponds to rotation in that plane. Now when you compute it, you're not always thinking about oh, you know, this corresponds to rotation in that plane and this corresponds to rotation in that plane, you're just kind of computing it to get a formula out, but I think it's kind of nice to recognize that all the intuition that we put into the two-dimensional curl does show up here and another thing I wanna emphasize is this is not a formula to be memorized.

89,t_e6191e4a8dd8,c_97a5889ab31c,0.9,0.9,c_97a5889ab31c,16.5: Divergence and Curl,". in this section, we examine two important operations on a vector field: divergence and curl. they are important to the field of calculus for several reasons, including the use of curl and divergence to develop some higher-dimensional versions of the fundamental theorem of calculus ( in addition, curl and divergence appear in mathematical descriptions of fluid mechanics, electromagnetism, and elasticity theory, which are important concepts in physics and engineering. we can also apply curl and divergence to other concepts we already explored. for example, under certain conditions, a vector field is conservative if and only if its curl is zero.  in addition to defining curl and divergence, we look at some physical interpretations of them, and show their relationship to conservative and source-free vector fields.  divergence  divergence is an operation on a vector field that tells us how the field behaves toward or away from a point. locally, the divergence of a vector field \(\vecs{f}\) in \(\mathbb{r}^\) or \(\mathbb{r}^\) at a particular point \(p\) is a measure of the “outflowing-ness” of the vector field at \(p\). if \(\vecs{f}\) represents the velocity of a fluid, then the divergence of \(\vecs{f}\) at \(p\) measures the net rate of change with respect to time of the amount of fluid flowing away from \(p\) (the tendency of the fluid to flow “out of” p). in particular, if the amount of fluid flowing into \(p\) is the same as the amount flowing out, then the divergence at \(p\) is zero.  definition: divergence in \(\mathbb{r}^\)  if \(\vecs{f} = \langle p,q,r \rangle\) is a vector field in \(\mathbb{r}^\) and \(px, \, qy, \) and \(rz\) all exist, then the divergence of \(\vecs{f}\) is defined by  \[\begin{align} div \, f &= px + qy + rz \\[] &= \dfrac{\partial p}{\partial x} + \dfrac{\partial q}{\partial y} + \dfrac{\partial r}{\partial z}. \end{align}\]  note the divergence of a vector field is not a vector field, but a scalar function. in terms of the gradient operator  \[\nabla = \langle \dfrac{\partial}{\partial x}, \dfrac{\partial}{\partial y}, \dfrac{\partial}{\partial z} \rangle\]  divergence can be written symbolically as the dot product (  \[div \, f = \nabla \cdot \vecs{f}.\]  note this is merely helpful notation, because the dot product of a vector of operators and a vector of functions is not meaningfully defined given our current definition of dot product.  if \(\vecs{f} = \langle p,q \rangle\) is a vector field in \(\mathbb{r}^\), and \(px\) and \(qy\) both exist, then the divergence of \(\vecs{f}\) is defined similarly as  \[\begin{align*} div \, \vecs{f} &= px + qy \\[] &= \dfrac{\partial p}{\partial x} + \dfrac{\partial q}{\partial y} \\[] &= \nabla \cdot \vecs{f}. \end{align*}\]  to illustrate this point, consider the two vector fields in figure \(\pageindex{}\). at any particular point, the amount flowing in is the same as the amount flowing out, so at every point the “outflowing-ness” of the field is zero. therefore, we expect the divergence of both fields to be zero, and this is indeed the case, as  \[div (\langle , \rangle ) = \dfrac{\partial}{\partial x} () + \dfrac{\partial}{\partial y}() =  \]  and  \[div (\langle -y,x \rangle ) = \dfrac{\partial}{\partial x} (-y) + \dfrac{\partial}{\partial y} (x) = .\]  figure \(\pageindex{}\): (a) vector field \(\langle , \rangle\) has zero divergence. (b) vector field \(\langle -y,x \rangle \) also has zero divergence.  by contrast, consider radial vector field \(\vecs{r} (x,y) = \langle -x, -y \rangle\) in figure \(\pageindex{}\). at any given point, more fluid is flowing in than is flowing out, and therefore the “outgoingness” of the field is negative. we expect the divergence of this field to be negative, and this is indeed the case, as  \[div (\vecs{r}) = \dfrac{\partial}{\partial x} (-x) + \dfrac{\partial}{\partial y} (-y) = -.\]  figure \(\pageindex{}\): this vector field has negative divergence.  to get a global sense of what divergence is telling us, suppose that a vector field in \(\mathbb{r}^\) represents the velocity of a fluid. imagine taking an elastic circle (a circle with a shape that can be changed by the vector field) and dropping it into a fluid. if the circle maintains its exact area as it flows through the fluid, then the divergence is zero. this would occur for both vector fields in figure \(\pageindex{}\). on the other hand, if the circle’s shape is distorted so that its area shrinks or expands, then the divergence is not zero. imagine dropping such an elastic circle into the radial vector field in figure \(\pageindex{}\) so that the center of the circle lands at point \((, )\). the circle would flow toward the origin, and as it did so the front of the circle would travel more slowly than the back, causing the circle to “scrunch” and lose area. this is how you can see a negative divergence.  example \(\pageindex{}\): calculating divergence at a point  if \(\vecs{f}(x,y,z) = e^x \hat{i} + yz \hat{j} - y^ \hat{k}\), then find the divergence of \(\vecs{f}\) at \((,,-)\).  solution  the divergence of \(\vecs{f}\) is  \[\dfrac{\partial}{\partial x} (e^x) + \dfrac{\partial}{\partial y}(yz) - \dfrac{\partial}{\partial z} (y z^) = e^x + z - . \nonumber\]  therefore, the divergence at \((,,-)\) is \(e^ -  +  = \). if \(\vecs{f}\) represents the velocity of a fluid, then more fluid is flowing out than flowing in at point \((,,-)\).  exercise \(\pageindex{}\)  find \(div \, \vecs{f}\) for  \[\vecs{f}(x,y,z) = \langle xy, \, -z^, \, x^ + y^ \rangle \nonumber.\]  hint  follow example \(\pageindex{}\).  answer  \(y - z^\)  one application for divergence occurs in physics, when working with magnetic fields. a magnetic field is a vector field that models the influence of electric currents and magnetic materials. physicists use divergence in gauss’s law for magnetism ( which states that if \(\vecs{b}\) is a magnetic field, then \(\nabla \cdot \vecs{b} = \); in other words, the divergence of a magnetic field is zero.  example \(\pageindex{}\): determining whether a field is magnetic  is it possible for \(\vecs{f} (x,y) = \langle x^ y, \, y - xy^ \rangle \) to be a magnetic field?  solution  if \(\vecs{f}\) were magnetic, then its divergence would be zero. the divergence of \(\vecs{f}\) is  \[\dfrac{\partial}{\partial x} (x^) + \dfrac{\partial}{\partial y} (y - xy^) =  xy +  -  xy =  \nonumber\]  and therefore \(\vecs{f}\) cannot model a magnetic field (figure \(\pageindex{}\)).  figure \(\pageindex{}\): the divergence of vector field \(\vecs{f} (x,y) = \langle x^ y, \, y - xy^ \rangle \) is one, so it cannot model a magnetic field.  ​​​​​another application for divergence is detecting whether a field is source free. recall that a source-free field is a vector field that has a stream function; equivalently, a source-free field is a field with a flux that is zero along any closed curve. the next two theorems say that, under certain conditions, source-free vector fields are precisely the vector fields with zero divergence.  theorem: divergence of a source-free vector field  if \(\vecs{f} = \langle p,q \rangle\) is a source-free continuous vector field with differentiable component functions, then \(div \, \vecs{f} = \).  proof  since \(\vecs{f}\) is source free, there is a function \(g(x,y)\) with \(gy = p\) and \(-gx = q\). therefore, \(\vecs{f} = \langle gy, -gx \rangle\) and \(div \, \vecs{f} = g{yx} - g{xy} = \) by clairaut’s theorem.  \(\square\)  the converse of divergence of a source-free vector field is true on simply connected regions, but the proof is too technical to include here. thus, we have the following theorem, which can test whether a vector field in \(\mathbb{r}^\) is source free.  theorem: divergence test for source-free vector fields  let \(\vecs{f} = \langle p,q \rangle \) be a continuous vector field with differentiable component functions with a domain that is simply connected. then, \(div \, \vecs{f} = \) if and only if \(\vecs{f}\) is source free.  example \(\pageindex{}\): determining whether a field is source free  is field \(\vecs{f} (x,y) = \langle x^ y, \,  - xy^ \rangle\) source free?  solution  note the domain of \(\vecs{f}\) is \(\mathbb{r}^\) which is simply connected. furthermore, \(\vecs{f}\) is continuous with differentiable component functions. therefore, we can use the divergence test for source-free vector fields to analyze \(\vecs{f}\). the divergence of \(\vecs{f}\) is  \[\dfrac{\partial}{\partial x} (x^ y) + \dfrac{\partial}{\partial y} ( - xy^ ) =  -  = . \nonumber\]  therefore, \(\vecs{f}\) is source free by the divergence test for source-free vector fields.  exercise \(\pageindex{}\)  let \(\vecs{f} (x,y) = \langle -ay, bx \rangle\) be a rotational field where \(a\) and \(b\) are positive constants. is \(\vecs{f}\) source free?  hint  calculate the divergence.  answer  yes  recall that the flux form of green’s theorem says that  \[\ointc f \cdot n ds = \iintd px + qy da,\]  where c is a simple closed curve and d is the region enclosed by c. since \(px + qy = div \, f\), green’s theorem is sometimes written as  \[\ointc f \cdot nds = \iintd div \, f da.\]  therefore, green’s theorem can be written in terms of divergence. if we think of divergence as a derivative of sorts, then green’s theorem says the “derivative” of \(\vecs{f}\) on a region can be translated into a line integral of \(\vecs{f}\) along the boundary of the region. this is analogous to the fundamental theorem of calculus, in which the derivative of a function \(f\) on a line segment \([a,b]\) can be translated into a statement about \(f\) on the boundary of \([a,b]\). using divergence, we can see that green’s theorem is a higher-dimensional analog of the fundamental theorem of calculus.  we can use all of what we have learned in the application of divergence. let \(\vecs{v}\) be a vector field modeling the velocity of a fluid. since the divergence of \(\vecs{v}\) at point p measures the “outflowing-ness” of the fluid at p, \(div \, v(p) &gt; \) implies that more fluid is flowing out of p than flowing in. similarly, \(div \, v(p) &lt; \) implies the more fluid is flowing in to p than is flowing out, and \(div \, \vecs{v}(p) = \) implies the same amount of fluid is flowing in as flowing out.  example \(\pageindex{}\): determining flow of a fluid  suppose \(\vecs{v}(x,y) = \langle -xy,y \rangle, \, y > \) models the flow of a fluid. is more fluid flowing into point \((,)\) than flowing out?  solution  to determine whether more fluid is flowing into \((,)\) than is flowing out, we calculate the divergence of v at \((,)\):  \[div(\vecs{v}) = \dfrac{\partial}{\partial x} (-xy) + \dfrac{\partial}{\partial y} (y) = -y + . \nonumber\]  to find the divergence at \((,)\) substitute the point into the divergence: \(- +  = -\). since the divergence of v at \((,)\) is negative, more fluid is flowing in than flowing out (figure \(\pageindex{}\)).  figure \(\pageindex{}\): vector field \(\vecs{v}(x,y) = \langle -xy, y \rangle\) has negative divergence at \((,)\)  exercise \(\pageindex{}\)  for vector field \(\vecs{v}(x,y) = \langle -xy, y \rangle , \, y &gt; \), find all points p such that the amount of fluid flowing in to p equals the amount of fluid flowing out of p.  hint  find where the divergence is zero.  answer  all points on line \(y = \).  curl  the second operation on a vector field that we examine is the curl, which measures the extent of rotation of the field about a point. suppose that \(\vecs{f}\) represents the velocity field of a fluid. then, the curl of \(\vecs{f}\) at point p is a vector that measures the tendency of particles near p to rotate about the axis that points in the direction of this vector. the magnitude of the curl vector at p measures how quickly the particles rotate around this axis. in other words, the curl at a point is a measure of the vector field’s “spin” at that point. visually, imagine placing a paddlewheel into a fluid at p, with the axis of the paddlewheel aligned with the curl vector (figure \(\pageindex{}\)). the curl measures the tendency of the paddlewheel to rotate.  figure \(\pageindex{}\): to visualize curl at a point, imagine placing a small paddlewheel into the vector field at a point.  consider the vector fields in figure \(\pageindex{}\). in part (a), the vector field is constant and there is no spin at any point. therefore, we expect the curl of the field to be zero, and this is indeed the case. part (b) shows a rotational field, so the field has spin. in particular, if you place a paddlewheel into a field at any point so that the axis of the wheel is perpendicular to a plane, the wheel rotates counterclockwise. therefore, we expect the curl of the field to be nonzero, and this is indeed the case (the curl is \(\)).  to see what curl is measuring globally, imagine dropping a leaf into the fluid. as the leaf moves along with the fluid flow, the curl measures the tendency of the leaf to rotate. if the curl is zero, then the leaf doesn’t rotate as it moves through the fluid.  definition: curl  if \(\vecs{f} = \langle p,q,r \rangle\) is a vector field in \(\mathbb{r}^\), and \(px, \, qy\), and \(rz\) all exist, then the curl of \(\vecs{f}\) is defined by  \[\begin{align} curl \, \vecs{f} &= (ry - qz) \hat{i} + (pz - rx) \hat{j} + (qx - py) \hat{k}\\ &= \left( \dfrac{\partial r}{\partial y} - \dfrac{\partial q}{\partial z} \right) \hat{i} + \left( \dfrac{\partial p}{\partial z} - \dfrac{\partial r}{\partial x} \right) \hat{j} + \left( \dfrac{\partial q}{\partial x} - \dfrac{\partial p}{\partial y} \right) \hat{k}. \end{align}\]  note that the curl of a vector field is a vector field, in contrast to divergence.  the definition of curl can be difficult to remember. to help with remembering, we use the notation \(\nabla \times \vecs{f}\) to stand for a “determinant” that gives the curl formula:  \[\begin{vmatrix} \hat{i} & \hat{j} & \hat{k} \nonumber \\ \dfrac{\partial}{\partial x} & \dfrac{\partial}{\partial y} & \dfrac{\partial}{\partial z} \nonumber \\ p & q & r \end{vmatrix}.\]  the determinant of this matrix is  \[(ry - qz) \hat{i} - (rx - pz) \hat{j} + (qx - py) \hat{k} = (ry - qz) \hat{i} + (pz - rx) \hat{j} + (qx - py)\hat{k} = curl \, \vecs{f}.\]  thus, this matrix is a way to help remember the formula for curl. keep in mind, though, that the word determinant is used very loosely. a determinant is not really defined on a matrix with entries that are three vectors, three operators, and three functions.  if \(\vecs{f} = \langle p,q \rangle\) is a vector field in \(\mathbb{r}^\), then the curl of \(\vecs{f}\), by definition, is  \[curl \, \vecs{f} = (qx - py)k = \left(\dfrac{\partial q}{\partial x} - \dfrac{\partial p}{\partial y} \right)k.\]  example \(\pageindex{}\): finding the curl of a three-dimensional vector field  find the curl of \(\vecs{f}(p,q,r) = \langle x^ z, e^y + xz, xyz \rangle\).  solution  the curl is  \[\begin{align*} curl \, f &= \nabla \times \vecs{f} \\&= \begin{vmatrix} \hat{i} & \hat{j} & \hat{k} \nonumber \\ \partial/\partial x & \partial/\partial y & \partial / \partial z \nonumber \\ p & q & r \end{vmatrix} \\ &= (ry - qz)\hat{i} + (pz - rx)\hat{j} + (qx - py)\hat{k} \\ &= (xz - x)\hat{i} + (x^ - yz)\hat{j} + z \hat{k}. \end{align*}\]  exercise \(\pageindex{}\)  find the curl of \(\vecs{f} = \langle \sin x \, \cos z, \, \sin y \, \sin z, \, \cos x \, \cos y \rangle \) at point \(\left(, \dfrac{\pi}{}, \dfrac{\pi}{} \right)\).  hint  find the determinant of matrix \(\nabla \times \vecs{f}\).  answer  \(-\hat{i}\)  example \(\pageindex{}\): finding the curl of a two-dimensional vector field  find the curl of \(\vecs{f} = \langle p,q \rangle = \langle y,\rangle\).  solution  notice that this vector field consists of vectors that are all parallel. in fact, each vector in the field is parallel to the x-axis. this fact might lead us to the conclusion that the field has no spin and that the curl is zero. to test this theory, note that  \[curl \, \vecs{f} = (qx - py)k = -k \neq .\]  therefore, this vector field does have spin. to see why, imagine placing a paddlewheel at any point in the first quadrant (figure \(\pageindex{}\)). the larger magnitudes of the vectors at the top of the wheel cause the wheel to rotate. the wheel rotates in the clockwise (negative) direction, causing the coefficient of the curl to be negative.  figure \(\pageindex{}\): vector field \(\vecs{f}(x,y) = \langle y,\rangle\) consists of vectors that are all parallel.  note that if \(\vecs{f} = \langle p,q\rangle\) is a vector field in a plane, then \(curl \, \vecs{f} \cdot k = (qx - py)k \cdot k = qx - py\). therefore, the circulation form of green’s theorem is sometimes written as  \[\ointc \vecs{f} \cdot dr = \iintd curl \, f \cdot kda,\]  where c is a simple closed curve and d is the region enclosed by c. therefore, the circulation form of green’s theorem can be written in terms of the curl. if we think of curl as a derivative of sorts, then green’s theorem says that the “derivative” of \(\vecs{f}\) on a region can be translated into a line integral of \(\vecs{f}\) along the boundary of the region. this is analogous to the fundamental theorem of calculus, in which the derivative of a function \(f\) on line segment \([a,b]\) can be translated into a statement about \(f\) on the boundary of \([a,b]\). using curl, we can see the circulation form of green’s theorem is a higher-dimensional analog of the fundamental theorem of calculus.  we can now use what we have learned about curl to show that gravitational fields have no “spin.” suppose there is an object at the origin with mass \(\) at the origin and an object with mass \(\). recall that the gravitational force that object  exerts on object  is given by field  \[ \vecs{f}(x,y,z) = -  \left\langle \dfrac{x}{(x^ + y^ + z^ )^{/}}, \dfrac{y}{(x^ + y^ + z^ )^{/}}, \dfrac{z}{(x^ + y^ + z^ )^{/}}\right\rangle.\]  example \(\pageindex{}\): determining the spin of a gravitational field  show that a gravitational field has no spin.  solution  to show that \(\vecs{f}\) has no spin, we calculate its curl. let  \(p(x,y,z) = \dfrac{x}{(x^ + y^ + z^ )^{/}}\),  \(q(x,y,z) = \dfrac{y}{(x^ + y^ + z^ )^{/}}\), and  \(r(x,y,z) = \dfrac{z}{(x^ + y^ + z^ )^{/}}\).  then,  \[\begin{align*} curl \, \vecs{f} &= -  [(ry - qz)i + (pz - rx)j + (qx - py)k] \\ &= -  \begin{pmatrix} \left(\dfrac{-}{(x^ + y^ + z^ )^{/}} - \left(\dfrac{-}{(x^ + y^ + z^ )^{/}} \right) \right) \hat{i} \nonumber \\[] + \left(\dfrac{-}{(x^ + y^ + z^ )^{/}} - \left(\dfrac{-}{(x^ + y^ + z^ )^{/}} \right) \right) \hat{j} \nonumber \\[] + \left(\dfrac{-}{(x^ + y^ + z^ )^{/}} - \left(\dfrac{-}{(x^ + y^ + z^ )^{/}} \right) \right) \hat{k} \end{pmatrix} \\ &= . \end{align*}\]  since the curl of the gravitational field is zero, the field has no spin.  exercise \(\pageindex{}\)  field \(\vecs{v}(x,y) = \langle -

They are important to the field of calculus for several reasons, including the use of curl and divergence to develop some higher-dimensional versions of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (https://math.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Calculus/Book%3A_Calculus_(Apex)/5%3A_Integration/5.4%3A_The_Fundamental_Theorem_of_Calculus). In addition, curl and divergence appear in mathematical descriptions of fluid mechanics, electromagnetism, and elasticity theory, which are important concepts in physics and engineering. We can also apply curl and divergence to other concepts we already explored. For example, under certain conditions, a vector field is conservative if and only if its curl is zero.

In addition to defining curl and divergence, we look at some physical interpretations of them, and show their relationship to conservative and source-free vector fields.

Divergence

Divergence is an operation on a vector field that tells us how the field behaves toward or away from a point. Locally, the divergence of a vector field \(\vecs{F}\) in \(\mathbb{R}^2\) or \(\mathbb{R}^3\) at a particular point \(P\) is a measure of the “outflowing-ness” of the vector field at \(P\). If \(\vecs{F}\) represents the velocity of a fluid, then the divergence of \(\vecs{F}\) at \(P\) measures the net rate of change with respect to time of the amount of fluid flowing away from \(P\) (the tendency of the fluid to flow “out of” P). In particular, if the amount of fluid flowing into \(P\) is the same as the amount flowing out, then the divergence at \(P\) is zero.

Definition: divergence in \(\mathbb{R}^3\)

If \(\vecs{F} = \langle P,Q,R \rangle\) is a vector field in \(\mathbb{R}^3\) and \(P_x, \, Q_y, \) and \(R_z\) all exist, then the divergence of \(\vecs{F}\) is defined by

\[\begin{align} div \, F &= P_x + Q_y + R_z \\[5pt] &= \dfrac{\partial P}{\partial x} + \dfrac{\partial Q}{\partial y} + \dfrac{\partial R}{\partial z}. \end{align}\]

Note the divergence of a vector field is not a vector field, but a scalar function. In terms of the gradient operator

\[\nabla = \langle \dfrac{\partial}{\partial x}, \dfrac{\partial}{\partial y}, \dfrac{\partial}{\partial z} \rangle\]

divergence can be written symbolically as the dot product (https://math.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Calculus/Map%3A_University_Calculus_(Hass_et_al.)/11%3A_Vectors_and_the_Geometry_of_Space/11.3%3A_The_Dot_Product)

\[div \, F = \nabla \cdot \vecs{F}.\]

Note this is merely helpful notation, because the dot product of a vector of operators and a vector of functions is not meaningfully defined given our current definition of dot product.

If \(\vecs{F} = \langle P,Q \rangle\) is a vector field in \(\mathbb{R}^2\), and \(P_x\) and \(Q_y\) both exist, then the divergence of \(\vecs{F}\) is defined similarly as

\[\begin{align*} div \, \vecs{F} &= P_x + Q_y \\[5pt] &= \dfrac{\partial P}{\partial x} + \dfrac{\partial Q}{\partial y} \\[5pt] &= \nabla \cdot \vecs{F}. \end{align*}\]

To illustrate this point, consider the two vector fields in Figure \(\PageIndex{1}\). At any particular point, the amount flowing in is the same as the amount flowing out, so at every point the “outflowing-ness” of the field is zero. Therefore, we expect the divergence of both fields to be zero, and this is indeed the case, as

\[div (\langle 1,2 \rangle ) = \dfrac{\partial}{\partial x} (1) + \dfrac{\partial}{\partial y}(2) = 0 \]

and

\[div (\langle -y,x \rangle ) = \dfrac{\partial}{\partial x} (-y) + \dfrac{\partial}{\partial y} (x) = 0.\]

Figure \(\PageIndex{1}\): (a) Vector field \(\langle 1,2 \rangle\) has zero divergence. (b) Vector field \(\langle -y,x \rangle \) also has zero divergence.

By contrast, consider radial vector field \(\vecs{R} (x,y) = \langle -x, -y \rangle\) in Figure \(\PageIndex{2}\). At any given point, more fluid is flowing in than is flowing out, and therefore the “outgoingness” of the field is negative. We expect the divergence of this field to be negative, and this is indeed the case, as

\[div (\vecs{R}) = \dfrac{\partial}{\partial x} (-x) + \dfrac{\partial}{\partial y} (-y) = -2.\]

Figure \(\PageIndex{2}\): This vector field has negative divergence.

To get a global sense of what divergence is telling us, suppose that a vector field in \(\mathbb{R}^2\) represents the velocity of a fluid. Imagine taking an elastic circle (a circle with a shape that can be changed by the vector field) and dropping it into a fluid. If the circle maintains its exact area as it flows through the fluid, then the divergence is zero. This would occur for both vector fields in Figure \(\PageIndex{1}\). On the other hand, if the circle’s shape is distorted so that its area shrinks or expands, then the divergence is not zero. Imagine dropping such an elastic circle into the radial vector field in Figure \(\PageIndex{2}\) so that the center of the circle lands at point \((3, 3)\). The circle would flow toward the origin, and as it did so the front of the circle would travel more slowly than the back, causing the circle to “scrunch” and lose area. This is how you can see a negative divergence.

Example \(\PageIndex{1}\): Calculating Divergence at a Point

If \(\vecs{F}(x,y,z) = e^x \hat{i} + yz \hat{j} - y^2 \hat{k}\), then find the divergence of \(\vecs{F}\) at \((0,2,-1)\).

Solution

The divergence of \(\vecs{F}\) is

\[\dfrac{\partial}{\partial x} (e^x) + \dfrac{\partial}{\partial y}(yz) - \dfrac{\partial}{\partial z} (y z^2) = e^x + z - 2yz. \nonumber\]

Therefore, the divergence at \((0,2,-1)\) is \(e^0 - 1 + 4 = 4\). If \(\vecs{F}\) represents the velocity of a fluid, then more fluid is flowing out than flowing in at point \((0,2,-1)\).

Exercise \(\PageIndex{1}\)

Find \(div \, \vecs{F}\) for

\[\vecs{F}(x,y,z) = \langle xy, \, 5-z^2, \, x^2 + y^2 \rangle \nonumber.\]

Hint

Follow Example \(\PageIndex{1}\).

Answer

\(y - z^2\)

One application for divergence occurs in physics, when working with magnetic fields. A magnetic field is a vector field that models the influence of electric currents and magnetic materials. Physicists use divergence in Gauss’s law for magnetism (https://phys.libretexts.org/TextMaps/General_Physics_Textmaps/Map%3A_Calculus-Based_Physics_(Schnick)/Volume_B%3A_Electricity%2C_Magnetism%2C_and_Optics/B35%3A_Gauss%E2%80%99s_Law_for_the_Magnetic_Field_and_Ampere%E2%80%99s_Law_Revisited), which states that if \(\vecs{B}\) is a magnetic field, then \(\nabla \cdot \vecs{B} = 0\); in other words, the divergence of a magnetic field is zero.

Example \(\PageIndex{2}\): Determining Whether a Field Is Magnetic

Is it possible for \(\vecs{F} (x,y) = \langle x^2 y, \, y - xy^2 \rangle \) to be a magnetic field?

Solution

If \(\vecs{F}\) were magnetic, then its divergence would be zero. The divergence of \(\vecs{F}\) is

\[\dfrac{\partial}{\partial x} (x^2y) + \dfrac{\partial}{\partial y} (y - xy^2) = 2 xy + 1 - 2 xy = 1 \nonumber\]

and therefore \(\vecs{F}\) cannot model a magnetic field (Figure \(\PageIndex{3}\)).

Figure \(\PageIndex{3}\): The divergence of vector field \(\vecs{F} (x,y) = \langle x^2 y, \, y - xy^2 \rangle \) is one, so it cannot model a magnetic field.

​​​​​Another application for divergence is detecting whether a field is source free. Recall that a source-free field is a vector field that has a stream function; equivalently, a source-free field is a field with a flux that is zero along any closed curve. The next two theorems say that, under certain conditions, source-free vector fields are precisely the vector fields with zero divergence.

Theorem: Divergence of a Source-Free Vector Field

If \(\vecs{F} = \langle P,Q \rangle\) is a source-free continuous vector field with differentiable component functions, then \(div \, \vecs{F} = 0\).

Proof

Since \(\vecs{F}\) is source free, there is a function \(g(x,y)\) with \(g_y = P\) and \(-g_x = Q\). Therefore, \(\vecs{F} = \langle g_y, -g_x \rangle\) and \(div \, \vecs{F} = g_{yx} - g_{xy} = 0\) by Clairaut’s theorem.

\(\square\)

The converse of Divergence of a Source-Free Vector Field is true on simply connected regions, but the proof is too technical to include here. Thus, we have the following theorem, which can test whether a vector field in \(\mathbb{R}^2\) is source free.

Theorem: Divergence Test for Source-Free Vector Fields

Let \(\vecs{F} = \langle P,Q \rangle \) be a continuous vector field with differentiable component functions with a domain that is simply connected. Then, \(div \, \vecs{F} = 0\) if and only if \(\vecs{F}\) is source free.

Example \(\PageIndex{3}\): Determining Whether a Field Is Source Free

Is field \(\vecs{F} (x,y) = \langle x^2 y, \, 5 - xy^2 \rangle\) source free?

Solution

Note the domain of \(\vecs{F}\) is \(\mathbb{R}^2\) which is simply connected. Furthermore, \(\vecs{F}\) is continuous with differentiable component functions. Therefore, we can use the Divergence Test for Source-Free Vector Fields to analyze \(\vecs{F}\). The divergence of \(\vecs{F}\) is

\[\dfrac{\partial}{\partial x} (x^2 y) + \dfrac{\partial}{\partial y} (5 - xy^2 ) = 2xy - 2xy = 0. \nonumber\]

Therefore, \(\vecs{F}\) is source free by the Divergence Test for Source-Free Vector Fields.

Exercise \(\PageIndex{2}\)

Let \(\vecs{F} (x,y) = \langle -ay, bx \rangle\) be a rotational field where \(a\) and \(b\) are positive constants. Is \(\vecs{F}\) source free?

Hint

Calculate the divergence.

Answer

Yes

Recall that the flux form of Green’s theorem says that

\[\oint_C F \cdot N ds = \iint_D P_x + Q_y dA,\]

where C is a simple closed curve and D is the region enclosed by C. Since \(P_x + Q_y = div \, F\), Green’s theorem is sometimes written as

\[\oint_C F \cdot Nds = \iint_D div \, F dA.\]

Therefore, Green’s theorem can be written in terms of divergence. If we think of divergence as a derivative of sorts, then Green’s theorem says the “derivative” of \(\vecs{F}\) on a region can be translated into a line integral of \(\vecs{F}\) along the boundary of the region. This is analogous to the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, in which the derivative of a function \(f\) on a line segment \([a,b]\) can be translated into a statement about \(f\) on the boundary of \([a,b]\). Using divergence, we can see that Green’s theorem is a higher-dimensional analog of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.

We can use all of what we have learned in the application of divergence. Let \(\vecs{v}\) be a vector field modeling the velocity of a fluid. Since the divergence of \(\vecs{v}\) at point P measures the “outflowing-ness” of the fluid at P, \(div \, v(P) &gt; 0\) implies that more fluid is flowing out of P than flowing in. Similarly, \(div \, v(P) &lt; 0\) implies the more fluid is flowing in to P than is flowing out, and \(div \, \vecs{v}(P) = 0\) implies the same amount of fluid is flowing in as flowing out.

Example \(\PageIndex{4}\): Determining Flow of a Fluid

Suppose \(\vecs{v}(x,y) = \langle -xy,y \rangle, \, y > 0\) models the flow of a fluid. Is more fluid flowing into point \((1,4)\) than flowing out?

Solution

To determine whether more fluid is flowing into \((1,4)\) than is flowing out, we calculate the divergence of v at \((1,4)\):

\[div(\vecs{v}) = \dfrac{\partial}{\partial x} (-xy) + \dfrac{\partial}{\partial y} (y) = -y + 1. \nonumber\]

To find the divergence at \((1,4)\) substitute the point into the divergence: \(-4 + 1 = -3\). Since the divergence of v at \((1,4)\) is negative, more fluid is flowing in than flowing out (Figure \(\PageIndex{4}\)).

Figure \(\PageIndex{4}\): Vector field \(\vecs{v}(x,y) = \langle -xy, y \rangle\) has negative divergence at \((1,4)\)

Exercise \(\PageIndex{3}\)

For vector field \(\vecs{v}(x,y) = \langle -xy, y \rangle , \, y &gt; 0\), find all points P such that the amount of fluid flowing in to P equals the amount of fluid flowing out of P.

Hint

Find where the divergence is zero.

Answer

All points on line \(y = 1\).

Curl

The second operation on a vector field that we examine is the curl, which measures the extent of rotation of the field about a point. Suppose that \(\vecs{F}\) represents the velocity field of a fluid. Then, the curl of \(\vecs{F}\) at point P is a vector that measures the tendency of particles near P to rotate about the axis that points in the direction of this vector. The magnitude of the curl vector at P measures how quickly the particles rotate around this axis. In other words, the curl at a point is a measure of the vector field’s “spin” at that point. Visually, imagine placing a paddlewheel into a fluid at P, with the axis of the paddlewheel aligned with the curl vector (Figure \(\PageIndex{5}\)). The curl measures the tendency of the paddlewheel to rotate.

Figure \(\PageIndex{5}\): To visualize curl at a point, imagine placing a small paddlewheel into the vector field at a point.

Consider the vector fields in Figure \(\PageIndex{1}\). In part (a), the vector field is constant and there is no spin at any point. Therefore, we expect the curl of the field to be zero, and this is indeed the case. Part (b) shows a rotational field, so the field has spin. In particular, if you place a paddlewheel into a field at any point so that the axis of the wheel is perpendicular to a plane, the wheel rotates counterclockwise. Therefore, we expect the curl of the field to be nonzero, and this is indeed the case (the curl is \(2k\)).

To see what curl is measuring globally, imagine dropping a leaf into the fluid. As the leaf moves along with the fluid flow, the curl measures the tendency of the leaf to rotate. If the curl is zero, then the leaf doesn’t rotate as it moves through the fluid.

Definition: Curl

If \(\vecs{F} = \langle P,Q,R \rangle\) is a vector field in \(\mathbb{R}^3\), and \(P_x, \, Q_y\), and \(R_z\) all exist, then the curl of \(\vecs{F}\) is defined by

\[\begin{align} curl \, \vecs{F} &= (R_y - Q_z) \hat{i} + (P_z - R_x) \hat{j} + (Q_x - P_y) \hat{k}\\ &= \left( \dfrac{\partial R}{\partial y} - \dfrac{\partial Q}{\partial z} \right) \hat{i} + \left( \dfrac{\partial P}{\partial z} - \dfrac{\partial R}{\partial x} \right) \hat{j} + \left( \dfrac{\partial Q}{\partial x} - \dfrac{\partial P}{\partial y} \right) \hat{k}. \end{align}\]

Note that the curl of a vector field is a vector field, in contrast to divergence.

The definition of curl can be difficult to remember. To help with remembering, we use the notation \(\nabla \times \vecs{F}\) to stand for a “determinant” that gives the curl formula:

\[\begin{vmatrix} \hat{i} & \hat{j} & \hat{k} \nonumber \\ \dfrac{\partial}{\partial x} & \dfrac{\partial}{\partial y} & \dfrac{\partial}{\partial z} \nonumber \\ P & Q & R \end{vmatrix}.\]

The determinant of this matrix is

\[(R_y - Q_z) \hat{i} - (R_x - P_z) \hat{j} + (Q_x - P_y) \hat{k} = (R_y - Q_z) \hat{i} + (P_z - R_x) \hat{j} + (Q_x - P_y)\hat{k} = curl \, \vecs{F}.\]

Thus, this matrix is a way to help remember the formula for curl. Keep in mind, though, that the word determinant is used very loosely. A determinant is not really defined on a matrix with entries that are three vectors, three operators, and three functions.

If \(\vecs{F} = \langle P,Q \rangle\) is a vector field in \(\mathbb{R}^2\), then the curl of \(\vecs{F}\), by definition, is

\[curl \, \vecs{F} = (Q_x - P_y)k = \left(\dfrac{\partial Q}{\partial x} - \dfrac{\partial P}{\partial y} \right)k.\]

Example \(\PageIndex{5}\): Finding the Curl of a Three-Dimensional Vector Field

Find the curl of \(\vecs{F}(P,Q,R) = \langle x^2 z, e^y + xz, xyz \rangle\).

Solution

The curl is

\[\begin{align*} curl \, f &= \nabla \times \vecs{F} \\&= \begin{vmatrix} \hat{i} & \hat{j} & \hat{k} \nonumber \\ \partial/\partial x & \partial/\partial y & \partial / \partial z \nonumber \\ P & Q & R \end{vmatrix} \\ &= (R_y - Q_z)\hat{i} + (P_z - R_x)\hat{j} + (Q_x - P_y)\hat{k} \\ &= (xz - x)\hat{i} + (x^2 - yz)\hat{j} + z \hat{k}. \end{align*}\]

Exercise \(\PageIndex{4}\)

Find the curl of \(\vecs{F} = \langle \sin x \, \cos z, \, \sin y \, \sin z, \, \cos x \, \cos y \rangle \) at point \(\left(0, \dfrac{\pi}{2}, \dfrac{\pi}{2} \right)\).

Hint

Find the determinant of matrix \(\nabla \times \vecs{F}\).

Answer

\(-\hat{i}\)

Example \(\PageIndex{6}\): Finding the Curl of a Two-Dimensional Vector Field

Find the curl of \(\vecs{F} = \langle P,Q \rangle = \langle y,0\rangle\).

Solution

Notice that this vector field consists of vectors that are all parallel. In fact, each vector in the field is parallel to the x-axis. This fact might lead us to the conclusion that the field has no spin and that the curl is zero. To test this theory, note that

\[curl \, \vecs{F} = (Q_x - P_y)k = -k \neq 0.\]

Therefore, this vector field does have spin. To see why, imagine placing a paddlewheel at any point in the first quadrant (Figure \(\PageIndex{6}\)). The larger magnitudes of the vectors at the top of the wheel cause the wheel to rotate. The wheel rotates in the clockwise (negative) direction, causing the coefficient of the curl to be negative.

Figure \(\PageIndex{6}\): Vector field \(\vecs{F}(x,y) = \langle y,0\rangle\) consists of vectors that are all parallel.

Note that if \(\vecs{F} = \langle P,Q\rangle\) is a vector field in a plane, then \(curl \, \vecs{F} \cdot k = (Q_x - P_y)k \cdot k = Q_x - P_y\). Therefore, the circulation form of Green’s theorem is sometimes written as

\[\oint_C \vecs{F} \cdot dr = \iint_D curl \, F \cdot kdA,\]

where C is a simple closed curve and D is the region enclosed by C. Therefore, the circulation form of Green’s theorem can be written in terms of the curl. If we think of curl as a derivative of sorts, then Green’s theorem says that the “derivative” of \(\vecs{F}\) on a region can be translated into a line integral of \(\vecs{F}\) along the boundary of the region. This is analogous to the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, in which the derivative of a function \(f\) on line segment \([a,b]\) can be translated into a statement about \(f\) on the boundary of \([a,b]\). Using curl, we can see the circulation form of Green’s theorem is a higher-dimensional analog of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.

We can now use what we have learned about curl to show that gravitational fields have no “spin.” Suppose there is an object at the origin with mass \(m_1\) at the origin and an object with mass \(m_2\). Recall that the gravitational force that object 1 exerts on object 2 is given by field

\[ \vecs{F}(x,y,z) = - Gm_1m_2 \left\langle \dfrac{x}{(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 )^{3/2}}, \dfrac{y}{(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 )^{3/2}}, \dfrac{z}{(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 )^{3/2}}\right\rangle.\]

Example \(\PageIndex{7}\): Determining the Spin of a Gravitational Field

Show that a gravitational field has no spin.

Solution

To show that \(\vecs{F}\) has no spin, we calculate its curl. Let

\(P(x,y,z) = \dfrac{x}{(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 )^{3/2}}\),

\(Q(x,y,z) = \dfrac{y}{(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 )^{3/2}}\), and

\(R(x,y,z) = \dfrac{z}{(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 )^{3/2}}\).

Then,

\[\begin{align*} curl \, \vecs{F} &= - Gm_1m_2 [(R_y - Q_z)i + (P_z - R_x)j + (Q_x - P_y)k] \\ &= - Gm_1m_2 \begin{pmatrix} \left(\dfrac{-3yz}{(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 )^{5/2}} - \left(\dfrac{-3yz}{(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 )^{5/2}} \right) \right) \hat{i} \nonumber \\[5pt] + \left(\dfrac{-3xz}{(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 )^{5/2}} - \left(\dfrac{-3xz}{(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 )^{5/2}} \right) \right) \hat{j} \nonumber \\[5pt] + \left(\dfrac{-3xy}{(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 )^{5/2}} - \left(\dfrac{-3xy}{(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 )^{5/2}} \right) \right) \hat{k} \end{pmatrix} \\ &= 0. \end{align*}\]

Since the curl of the gravitational field is zero, the field has no spin.

Exercise \(\PageIndex{7}\)

Field \(\vecs{v}(x,y) = \langle - \dfrac{y}{x^2+y^2}, \dfrac{x}{x^2+y^2} \rangle \) models the flow of a fluid. Show that if you drop a leaf into this fluid, as the leaf moves over time, the leaf does not rotate.

Hint

Calculate the curl.

Answer

\(curl \, \vecs{v} = 0\)

Using Divergence and Curl

Now that we understand the basic concepts of divergence and curl, we can discuss their properties and establish relationships between them and conservative vector fields.

If \(\vecs{F}\) is a vector field in \(\mathbb{R}^3\) then the curl of \(\vecs{F}\) is also a vector field in \(\mathbb{R}^3\). Therefore, we can take the divergence of a curl. The next theorem says that the result is always zero. This result is useful because it gives us a way to show that some vector fields are not the curl of any other field. To give this result a physical interpretation, recall that divergence of a velocity field \(\vecs{v}\) at point P measures the tendency of the corresponding fluid to flow out of P. Since \(div \, curl \, (v) = 0\), the net rate of flow in vector field curl(v) at any point is zero. Taking the curl of vector field \(\vecs{F}\) eliminates whatever divergence was present in \(\vecs{F}\).

Theorem: Divergence of the Curl

Let \(\vecs{F} = \langle P,Q,R \rangle \) be a vector field in \(\mathbb{R}^3\) such that the component functions all have continuous second-order partial derivatives. Then,

\[div \, curl \, (\vecs{F}) = \nabla \cdot (\nabla \times F) = 0.\]

Proof

By the definitions of divergence and curl, and by Clairaut’s theorem,

\[\begin{align*} div \, curl \, \vecs{F} &= div [(R_y - Q_z)i + (P_z - R_x)j + (Q_x - P_y)k] \\ &= R_{yx} - Q_{xz} + P_{yz} - R_{yx} + Q_{zx} - P_{zy}\\ &= 0. \end{align*}\]

\(\Box\)

Example \(\PageIndex{8}\): Showing That a Vector Field Is Not the Curl of Another

Show that \(\vecs{F}(x,y,z) = e^xi + yzj + xz^2k\) is not the curl of another vector field. That is, show that there is no other vector \(\vecs{G}\) with \(curl \, G = F\).

Solution

Notice that the domain of \(\vecs{F}\) is all of \(\mathbb{R}^3\) and the second-order partials of \(\vecs{F}\) are all continuous. Therefore, we can apply the previous theorem to \(\vecs{F}\).

The divergence of \(\vecs{F}\) is \(e^x + z + 2xz\). If \(\vecs{F}\) were the curl of vector field \(\vecs{G}\), then \(div \, F = div \, curl G = 0\). But, the divergence of \(\vecs{F}\) is not zero, and therefore \(\vecs{F}\) is not the curl of any other vector field.

Exercise \(\PageIndex{8}\)

Is it possible for \(G(x,y,z) = \langle \sin x, \, \cos y, \, \sin (xyz)\rangle \) to be the curl of a vector field?

Hint

Find the divergence of \(\vecs{G}\).

Answer

No.

With the next two theorems, we show that if \(\vecs{F}\) is a conservative vector field then its curl is zero, and if the domain of \(\vecs{F}\) is simply connected then the converse is also true. This gives us another way to test whether a vector field is conservative.

Theorem: Curl of a Conservative Vector Field

If \(\vecs{F} = \langle P,Q,R\rangle\) is conservative, then \(curl \, \vecs{F} = 0\).

Proof

Since conservative vector fields satisfy the cross-partials property, all the cross-partials of F are equal. Therefore,

\[\begin{align*} curl \, \vecs{F} &= (R_y - Q_z)i + (P_z - R_x)j + (Q_x - P_y)k \\[5pt] &= 0. \end{align*}\]

\(\Box\)

The same theorem is true for vector fields in a plane.

Since a conservative vector field is the gradient of a scalar function, the previous theorem says that \(curl \, (\nabla f) = 0\) for any scalar function \(f\). In terms of our curl notation, \(\nabla \times \nabla (f) = 0\). This equation makes sense because the cross product of a vector with itself is always the zero vector. Sometimes equation \(\nabla \times \nabla (f) = 0\) is simplified as \(\nabla \times \nabla = 0\).

Theorem: Curl Test for a Conservative Field

Let \(\vecs{F} = \langle P,Q,R\rangle\) be a vector field in space on a simply connected domain. If \(curl \, F = 0\), then \(\vecs{F}\) is conservative.

Proof

Since \(curl \, F = 0\), we have that \(R_y = Q_z, \, P_z = R_x\), and \(Q_x = P_y\). Therefore, \(\vecs{F}\) satisfies the cross-partials property on a simply connected domain, and the Cross-Partial Property of Conservative Fields implies that \(\vecs{F}\) is conservative.

\(\Box\)

The same theorem is also true in a plane. Therefore, if \(\vecs{F}\) is a vector field in a plane or in space and the domain is simply connected, then \(\vecs{F}\) is conservative if and only if \(curl \, F = 0\).

Example \(\PageIndex{9}\): Testing Whether a Vector Field Is Conservative

Use the curl to determine whether \(\vecs{F}(x,y,z) = \langle yz, xz, xy\rangle\) is conservative.

Solution

Note that the domain of \(\vecs{F}\) is all of \(\mathbb{R}^3\) which is simply connected (Figure \(\PageIndex{7}\)). Therefore, we can test whether \(\vecs{F}\) is conservative by calculating its curl.

Figure \(\PageIndex{7}\): The curl of vector field \(\vecs{F}(x,y,z) = \langle yz, xz, xy\rangle\) is zero.

The curl of \(\vecs{F}\) is

\[\left(\dfrac{\partial}{\partial y}xy - \dfrac{\partial}{\partial z} xz \right) \hat{i} + \left(\dfrac{\partial}{\partial y}yz - \dfrac{\partial}{\partial z} xy \right) \hat{j} + \left(\dfrac{\partial}{\partial y}xz - \dfrac{\partial}{\partial z} yz \right)\hat{k}= (x - x)\hat{i} + (y - y)\hat{j} + (z - z)\hat{k} = 0. \nonumber\]

Thus, \(\vecs{F}\) is conservative.

We have seen that the curl of a gradient is zero. What is the divergence of a gradient? If \(f\) is a function of two variables, then \(div (\nabla f) = \nabla \cdot (\nabla f) = f_{xx} + f_{yy}\). We abbreviate this “double dot product” as \(\nabla^2\). This operator is called the Laplace operator, and in this notation Laplace’s equation becomes \(\nabla^2 f = 0\). Therefore, a harmonic function is a function that becomes zero after taking the divergence of a gradient.

Similarly, if \(f\) is a function of three variables then

\[div (\nabla f) = \nabla \cdot (\nabla f) = f_{xx} + f_{yy} + f_{zz}.\]

Using this notation we get Laplace’s equation for harmonic functions of three variables:

\[\nabla^2 f = 0.\]

Harmonic functions arise in many applications. For example, the potential function of an electrostatic field in a region of space that has no static charge is harmonic.

Example \(\PageIndex{10}\): Finding a Potential Function

Is it possible for \(f(x,y) = x^2 + x - y\) to be the potential function of an electrostatic field that is located in a region of \(\mathbb{R}^2\) free of static charge?

Solution

If \(f\) were such a potential function, then \(f\) would be harmonic. Note that \(f_{xx} = 2\) and \(f_{yy} = 0\), and so \(f_{xx} + f_{yy} \neq 0\). Therefore, \(f\) is not harmonic and \(f\) cannot represent an electrostatic potential.

Exercise \(\PageIndex{10}\)

Is it possible for function \(f(x,y) = x^2 - y^2 + x\) to be the potential function of an electrostatic field located in a region of \(\mathbb{R}^2\) free of static charge?

Hint

Determine whether the function is harmonic.

Answer

Yes.

Key Concepts

The divergence of a vector field is a scalar function. Divergence measures the “outflowing-ness” of a vector field. If \(\vecs{v}\) is the velocity field of a fluid, then the divergence of \(\vecs{v}\) at a point is the outflow of the fluid less the inflow at the point.

The curl of a vector field is a vector field. The curl of a vector field at point \(P\) measures the tendency of particles at \(P\) to rotate about the axis that points in the direction of the curl at \(P\).

A vector field with a simply connected domain is conservative if and only if its curl is zero.

Key Equations

Curl

\[\nabla \times \vecs{F} = (R_y - Q_z)\hat{i} + (P_z - R_x)\hat{j} + (Q_x - P_y)\hat{k} \nonumber\]

Divergence

\[\nabla \cdot \vecs{F} = P_x + Q_y + R_z\nonumber\]

Divergence of curl is zero

\[\nabla \cdot (\nabla \times F) = 0\nonumber\]

Curl of a gradient is the zero vector

\[\nabla \times (\nabla f) = 0 \nonumber \]

This is a text on elementary trigonometry, designed for students who have completed courses in high-school algebra and geometry. Though designed for college students, it could also be used in high schools. The traditional topics are covered, but a more geometrical approach is taken than usual. Also, some numerical methods (e.g. the secant method for solving trigonometric equations) are discussed.

Figure 2.2.4 Exercise 11

2.2.11  Two circles of radii \(5 \) and \(3 \) cm, respectively, intersect at two points. At either point of intersection, the tangent lines to the circles form a \(60^\circ\) angle, as in Figure 2.2.4 above. Find the distance between the centers of the circles.  2.2.12  Use the Law of Cosines to show that for any triangle \(\triangle\,ABC \), \(c^2 &lt; a^2 + b^2 \) if \(C \) is acute, \(c^2 &gt; a^2 + b^2 \) if \(C \) is obtuse, and \(c^2 = a^2 + b^2\) if \(C \) is a right angle.  2.2.13  Show that for any triangle \(\triangle\,ABC \), \[\nonumber   \frac{\cos\;A}{a} ~+~ \frac{\cos\;B}{b} ~+~ \frac{\cos\;C}{c} ~=~ \frac{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}{2abc}~. \]  2.2.14  Show that for any triangle \(\triangle\,ABC \), \[\nonumber   \cos\;A ~+~ \cos\;B ~+~ \cos\;C ~=~ \frac{a^2 \;(b+c-a)~+~ b^2 \;(a+c-b)~+~ c^2 \;(a+b-c)}{2abc}~. \] What do the terms in parentheses represent geometrically?

Show that the sum of the squares of the three medians of a triangle is \(\frac{3}{4}\) the sum of the squares of the sides.  2.2.17  The Dutch astronomer and mathematician Willebrord Snell (1580-1626) wrote the Law of Cosines as \[   \frac{2ab}{c^2 \;-\; (a - b)^2} ~=~ \frac{1}{1 \;-\; \cos\;C} \] in his trigonometry text Doctrina triangulorum (published a year after his death). Show that this formula is equivalent to Equation 2.11 in our statement of the Law of Cosines.  2.2.18  Suppose that a satellite in space, an earth station, and the center of the earth all lie in the same plane. Let \(r_e \) be the radius of the earth, let \(r_s \) be the distance from the center of the earth to the satellite (called the orbital radius of the satellite), and let \(d \) be the distance from the earth station to the satellite. Let \(E \) be the angle of elevation from the earth station to the satellite, and let \(\gamma \) and \(\psi \) be the angles shown in Figure 2.25.

Figure 2.2.5

Use the Law of Cosines to show that \[  d ~=~ r_s \,\sqrt{1 \;+\; \left( \frac{r_e}{r_s} \right)^2 \;-\; 2\,\left( \frac{r_e}{r_s} \right)  \,\cos\;\gamma} ~~, \] and then use \(E=\psi-90^\circ \) and the Law of Sines to show that \[  \cos\;E ~=~ \dfrac{\sin\;\gamma}{\sqrt{1 \;+\; \left( \dfrac{r_e}{r_s} \right)^2 \;-\;   2\,\left( \dfrac{r_e}{r_s} \right) \,\cos\;\gamma}} ~. \] Note: This formula allows the angle of elevation \(E \) to be calculated from the coordinates of the earth station and the subsatellite point (where the line from the satellite to the center of the earth crosses the surface of the earth).

If the rope is 150 ft long, what is the maximum distance along the ground from the base of the pole to where the other end can be attached? You may assume that the pole is perpendicular to the ground.  1.1.11  Prove that the hypotenuse is the longest side in every right triangle. (Hint: Is \(a^2 + b^2 &gt; a^2\)?)  1.1.12  Can a right triangle have sides with lengths 2, 5, and 6? Explain your answer.   1.1.13  If the lengths \(a \), \(b \), and \(c \) of the sides of a right triangle are positive integers, with \(a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \), then they form what is called a Pythagorean triple. The triple is normally written as (\(a \),\(b \),\(c\)). For example, (3,4,5) and (5,12,13) are well-known Pythagorean triples. (a)  Show that (6,8,10) is a Pythagorean triple. (b)  Show that if (\(a \),\(b \),\(c\)) is a Pythagorean triple then so is (\(ka \),\(kb \),\(kc\)) for any integer \(k &gt;0 \). How would you interpret this geometrically?

(d)  The triple in part(c) is known as Euclid's formula for generating Pythagorean triples. Write down the first ten Pythagorean triples generated by this formula, i.e. use: \(m=2 \) and \(n=1\); \(m=3 \) and \(n=1 \), \(2\); \(m=4 \) and \(n=1 \), \(2 \), \(3\); \(m=5 \) and \(n=1 \), \(2 \), \(3 \), \(4 \).  1.1.14  This exercise will describe how to draw a line through any point outside a circle such that the line intersects the circle at only one point. This is called a tangent line to the circle (see the picture on the left in Figure 1.1.6), a notion which we will use throughout the text.

Figure 1.1.6

On a sheet of paper draw a circle of radius 1 inch, and call the center of that circle \(O \). Pick a point \(P \) which is \(2.5 \) inches away from \(O \). Draw the circle which has \(\overline{OP} \) as a diameter, as in the picture on the right in Figure 1.1.6. Let \(A \) be one of the points where this circle intersects the first circle. Draw the line through \(P \) and \(A \). In general the tangent line through a point on a circle is perpendicular to the line joining that point to the center of the circle (why?). Use this fact to explain why the line you drew is the tangent line through \(A \) and to calculate the length of \(\overline{PA} \). Does it match the physical measurement of \(\overline{PA}\)?   1.1.15  Suppose that \(\triangle\,ABC \) is a triangle with side \(\overline{AB} \) a diameter of a circle with center \(O \), as in the picture on the right, and suppose that the vertex \(C \) lies on the circle. Now imagine that you rotate the circle \(180^\circ \) around its center, so that \(\triangle\,ABC \) is in a new position, as indicated by the dashed lines in the picture. Explain how this picture proves Thales' Theorem.

1.3.2  Generalize Example 1.12: A person standing \(a \) ft from the base of a mountain measures an angle of elevation \(\alpha \) from the ground to the top of the mountain. The person then walks \(b \) ft straight back and measures an angle of elevation \(\beta \) to the top of the mountain, as in the picture on the right.

1.3.15  \(a = 5 \), \(b = 12\)  1.3.16  \(c = 6 \), \(B = 35^\circ\)  1.3.17  \(b = 2 \), \(A = 8^\circ\)  1.3.18  \(a = 2 \), \(c = 7\)  1.3.19  \(a = 3 \), \(A = 26^\circ\)  1.3.20  \(b = 1 \), \(c = 2\)

1.3.21  \(b = 3 \), \(B = 26^\circ\)  1.3.22  \(a = 2 \), \(B = 8^\circ\)  1.3.23  \(c = 2 \), \(A = 45^\circ\)  1.3.24  In Example 1.10 in Section 1.2, we found the exact values of all six trigonometric functions of \(75^\circ \). For example, we showed that \(\cot\;75^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{6} -  \sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{6} + \sqrt{2}} \). So since \(\tan\;15^\circ = \cot\;75^\circ \) by the Cofunction Theorem, this means that \(\tan\;15^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{6} - \sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{6} + \sqrt{2}} \). We will now describe another method for finding the exact values of the trigonometric functions of \(15^\circ \). In fact, it can be used to find the exact values for the trigonometric functions of \(\frac{\theta}{2} \) when those for \(\theta \) are known, for any \(0^\circ &lt; \theta &lt; 90^\circ \). The method is illustrated in Figure 1.3.5 and is described below.

Figure 1.3.5

Draw a semicircle of radius \(1 \) centered at a point \(O \) on a horizontal line. Let \(P \) be the point on the semicircle such that \(\overline{OP} \) makes an angle of \(60^\circ \) with the horizontal line, as in Figure 1.3.5. Draw a line straight down from \(P \) to the horizontal line at the point \(Q \). Now create a second semicircle as follows: Let \(A \) be the left endpoint of the first semicircle, then draw a new semicircle centered at \(A \) with radius equal to \(AP \). Then create a third semicircle in the same way: Let \(B \) be the left endpoint of the second semicircle, then draw a new semicircle centered at \(B \) with radius equal to \(BP \).

This procedure can be continued indefinitely to create more semicircles. In general, it can be shown that the line segment from the center of the new semicircle to \(P \) makes an angle with the horizontal line equal to half the angle from the previous semicircle's center to \(P \).  (a)  Explain why \(\angle\,PAQ=30^\circ \). (Hint: What is the supplement of \(60^\circ\)?) (b)  Explain why \(\angle\,PBQ=15^\circ \) and \(\angle\,PCQ=7.5^\circ \). (c)  Use Figure 1.3.5 to find the exact values of \(\sin\;15^\circ \), \(\cos\;15^\circ \), and \(\tan\;15^\circ \). (Hint: To start, you will need to use \(\angle\,POQ = 60^\circ\) and \(OP = 1 \) to find the exact lengths of \(\overline{PQ} \) and \(\overline{OQ} \).) (d)  Use Figure 1.3.5 to calculate the exact value of \(\tan\;7.5^\circ \). (e)  Use the same method but with an initial angle of \(\angle\,POQ = 45^\circ \) to find the exact values of \(\sin\;22.5^\circ \), \(\cos\;22.5^\circ \), and \(\tan\;22.5^\circ \).   1.3.25  A manufacturer needs to place ten identical ball bearings against the inner side of a circular container such that each ball bearing touches two other ball bearings, as in the picture on the right. The (inner) radius of the container is \(4 \) cm.

(a)  Find the common radius \(r \) of the ball bearings. (b)  The manufacturer needs to place a circular ring\\inside the container. What is the largest possible (outer) radius of the ring such that it is not on top\\of the ball bearings and its base is level with the\\base of the container?  1.3.26  A circle of radius \(1 \) is inscribed inside a polygon with eight sides of equal length, called a regular octagon. That is, each of the eight sides is tangent to the circle, as in the picture on the right.

(a)  Calculate the area of the octagon. (b)  If you were to increase the number of sides of the\\polygon, would the area inside it increase or decrease? What number would the area approach, if any? Explain. (c)  Inscribe a regular octagon inside the same circle. That is, draw a regular octagon such that each of its eight vertexes touches the circle. Calculate the area of this octagon.   1.3.27  The picture on the right shows a cube whose sides are of length \(a &gt; 0 \).

(a)  Find the length of the diagonal line segment \(\overline{AB} \). (b) Find the angle \(\theta \) that \(\overline{AB} \) makes with the base of the cube.  1.3.28  In Figure 1.3.6, suppose that \(\alpha \), \(\beta \), and \(AD \) are known. Show that:

(a)  \(BC ~=~ \dfrac{AD}{\cot\;\alpha - \cot\;\beta}\) (b)  \(AC ~=~ \dfrac{AD\;\cdot\;\tan\;\beta}{\tan\;\beta - \tan\;\alpha}\) (c)  \(BD ~=~ \dfrac{AD\;\cdot\;\sin\;\alpha}{\sin\;(\beta - \alpha)}\) (Hint: What is the measure of the angle \(\angle\,ABD\;\)?)  1.3.29  Persons A and B are at the beach, their eyes are \(5 \) ft and \(6 \) ft, respectively, above sea level. How many miles farther out is Person B's horizon than Person A's? (Note: \(1 \) mile = \(5280\) ft)

  if a triangle is similar to another, then the within-figure ratios can be used to find the unknown lengths of the other triangle. for example, if the ratio that compares the height to the hypotenuse is known for one triangle and that ratio is equal to ., then a ratio that compares the height to the hypotenuse of a similar triangle will also be equal to ..  exit ticket ( minutes)  lesson :  between-figure and within-figure ratios  this work is derived from eureka math ™ and licensed by great minds. © great minds. eureka-math.org this file derived from geo--te-..-.   this work is licensed under a creative commons attribution-noncommercial-sharealike . unported license.  lesson   nys common core mathematics curriculum    geometry  name  date  lesson : between-figure and within-figure ratios exit ticket dennis needs to fix a leaky roof on his house but does not own a ladder. he thinks that a  ft. ladder will be long enough to reach the roof, but he needs to be sure before he spends the money to buy one. he chooses a point 𝑃 on the ground where he can visually align the roof of his car with the edge of the house roof. help dennis determine if a  ft. ladder will be long enough for him to safely reach his roof.  lesson :  between-figure and within-figure ratios  this work is derived from eureka math ™ and licensed by great minds. © great minds. eureka-math.org this file derived from geo--te-..-.   this work is licensed under a creative commons attribution-noncommercial-sharealike . unported license.  nys common core mathematics curriculum  lesson     geometry  exit ticket sample solutions dennis needs to fix a leaky roof on his house but does not own a ladder. he thinks that a  𝐟𝐭. ladder will be long enough to reach the roof, but he needs to be sure before he spends the money to buy one. he chooses a point 𝑷 on the ground where he can visually align the roof of his car with the edge of the house roof. help dennis determine if a  𝐟𝐭. ladder will be long enough for him to safely reach his roof. the height of the edge of the roof from the ground is unknown, so let 𝒙 represent the distance from the ground to the edge of the roof. the nested triangles are similar triangles by the aa criterion for similar triangles because they share ∠𝑷, and the height of the car and the distance from the ground to the edge of the house roof are both measured perpendicular to the ground. therefore, the following is true: (.  +  ) .  = .  𝒙 .  = .  𝒙 = .  … 𝒙 ≈ . . the distance from the ground to the edge of the roof is .  𝐟𝐭.

Lesson 16: Between-Figure and Within-Figure Ratios

f

Student Outcomes


Students indirectly solve for measurements involving right triangles using scale factors, ratios between similar
figures, and ratios within similar figures.



Students use trigonometric ratios to solve applied problems.

Lesson Notes
By now, students are very familiar with how to use a scale factor with similar figures to determine unknown lengths of
figures. This lesson demonstrates how the values of the ratios of corresponding sides between figures can be rewritten,
equivalently, as ratios of corresponding lengths within figures. This work foreshadows ratios related to trigonometry.
Though sine, cosine, and tangent are not formally defined in this lesson, students are essentially using the ratios as a
premise for formal treatment of trigonometric ratios in Topic E.

Example 1 (14 minutes)
The discussion following this exercise highlights length relationships within figures. Many students rely on ratios of
lengths between figures to solve for unknown measurements of sides rather than use ratios of lengths within a figure.
This example shows students that comparing ratios between and within figures is mathematically equivalent.

̅̅̅̅ and 𝐴′𝐵′
and ̅̅̅̅̅
𝐴′𝐶′) to determine the measurements of 𝐵𝐶



Are there any other length relationships we could use to set up an equation and solve for the missing side
lengths?

Provide students time to think about and try different equations that would lead to the same answer.


MP.7

In addition to the ratio of corresponding lengths 𝐴𝐶: 𝐴′𝐶′, we can use a ratio of lengths within one of
the triangles. For example, we could use the ratio of 𝐴𝐶: 𝐴𝐵 to find the length of ̅̅̅̅̅̅
𝐴′𝐵′. Equating the
values of the ratios, we get the following:

To find the length of 𝐵𝐶
ratios, we get the following:

𝐵𝐶 = 2.



Why is it possible to use this length relationship, 𝐴𝐶: 𝐴𝐵, to solve for a missing side length?



There are three methods that we can use to determine the missing side lengths.



Take student responses, and then offer the following explanation:

Method 1 (Scale Factor): Find the scale factor, and use it to compute for the desired side lengths.
Since we know 𝐴𝐶 = 4 and the corresponding side 𝐴′ 𝐶 ′ = 12, the scale factor of 𝑟 satisfies 4𝑟 = 12. So,
𝑟 = 3, 𝐴′ 𝐵′ = 𝑟𝐴𝐵 = 3 ⋅ 5 = 15, and 𝐵𝐶 =

𝐵′𝐶′ 6

Why does Method 3 work? That is, why can we use values of ratios within each triangle to find the missing
side lengths?

Provide students time to explain why Method 3 works, and then offer the following explanation:


If △ 𝐴𝐵𝐶 ~ △ 𝐴′𝐵′𝐶′, then it is true that the ratio between any two side lengths of the first triangle is equal to
the ratio between the corresponding side lengths of the second triangle; for example, 𝐴𝐵: 𝐵𝐶 = 𝐴′𝐵′: 𝐵′𝐶′.
This is because if 𝑟 is the scale factor, then 𝐴𝐵: 𝐵𝐶 = 𝑟𝐴𝐵: 𝑟𝐵𝐶 = 𝐴′ 𝐵′ : 𝐵′𝐶′.

Revisit the Opening Exercise. Ask students to explain which method they used to write their equations for the height of
the tree. Answers may vary, but students likely have used Method 2 because that is what is most familiar to them.

Example 2 (7 minutes)
In this example, students use what they know about similar figures to indirectly measure the height of a building. If
possible, use an image from the school or community to personalize the example.


Suppose you want to know the height of a building. Would it make sense to climb to the roof and use a tape
measure? Possibly. Suppose you want to know the distance between the earth and the moon. Would a tape
measure work in that situation? Not likely. For now, we will take indirect measurements of trees and
buildings, but we will soon learn how the Greeks measured the distance from the earth to the moon.
Example 2

In the diagram above, a large flagpole stands outside of an office building. Marquis realizes that when he looks up from
the ground 𝟔𝟎 𝐦 away from the flagpole, the top of the flagpole and the top of the building line up. If the flagpole is
𝟑𝟓 𝐦 tall and Marquis is 𝟏𝟕𝟎 𝐦 from the building, how tall is the building?

Are the triangles in the diagram similar? Explain.
Yes, the triangle formed by Marquis, the ground, and the flagpole is similar to the triangle formed by
Marquis, the ground, and the building. They are similar by the AA criterion. Each of the triangles has a
common angle with Marquis at the vertex, and each triangle has a right angle, where the flagpole and the
building meet the ground.

Example 3 (12 minutes)
Work through the following example with students. The goal is for them to recognize how the value of the ratio within a
figure can be used to determine an unknown side length of a similar figure. Make clear to students that more than one
ratio (from parts (a)–(c)) can be used to determine the requested unknown lengths in parts (d)–(f).
Example 3
The following right triangles are similar. We will determine the unknown side lengths by using
ratios within the first triangle. For each of the triangles below, we define the base as the
horizontal length of the triangle and the height as the vertical length.

Scaffolding:
 It may benefit some
groups of students to
show only the 3– 4– 5
triangle as they complete
parts (a)–(c) of the
example.
 Have advanced learners
consider why the triangle
is called a 3– 4– 5 triangle
and determine the
significance of these
numbers to any triangle
that is similar to it.

How does the relationship you noted in part (g) allow you to determine the length of an unknown side of a

This relationship allows us to find the length of an unknown side of a triangle. We can write the ratio of
corresponding sides within the figure that contains the unknown side length. This ratio will be equal to the
value of the ratio of corresponding sides where the lengths are known. Since the ratios are equal, the
unknown length can be found by solving a simple equation.

Closing (5 minutes)
To close the lesson, the following three questions may be asked separately. Or let students complete a Quick Write for
all three prompts, and then discuss the three questions all at one time.


What does it mean to use between-figure ratios of corresponding sides of similar triangles?




What does it mean to use within-figure ratios of corresponding sides of similar triangles?




Between-figure ratios are those where each ratio compares corresponding side lengths between two
similar figures. That is, one number of the ratio comes from one triangle while the other number in the
ratio comes from a different, similar triangle.
Within-figure ratios are those where each ratio is composed of side lengths from one figure of the
similar figures. That is, one ratio contains numbers that represent the side lengths from one triangle,
and a second ratio contains numbers that represent the side lengths from a second, similar triangle.

How can within-figure ratios be used to find unknown side lengths of similar triangles?


If a triangle is similar to another, then the within-figure ratios can be used to find the unknown lengths
of the other triangle. For example, if the ratio that compares the height to the hypotenuse is known for
one triangle and that ratio is equal to 0.6, then a ratio that compares the height to the hypotenuse of a
similar triangle will also be equal to 0.6.

Dennis needs to fix a leaky roof on his house but does not own a ladder. He thinks that a 𝟐𝟓 𝐟𝐭. ladder will be long

ground where he can visually align the roof of his car with the edge of the house roof. Help Dennis determine if a 𝟐𝟓 𝐟𝐭.
ladder will be long enough for him to safely reach his roof.
The height of the edge of the roof from the ground is
unknown, so let 𝒙 represent the distance from the ground
to the edge of the roof. The nested triangles are similar
triangles by the AA criterion for similar triangles because
they share ∠𝑷, and the height of the car and the distance
from the ground to the edge of the house roof are both
measured perpendicular to the ground. Therefore, the
following is true:

𝟑𝟎𝟐. 𝟕𝟓 𝐟𝐭. from the base of the monument. His visual
line forms two similar right triangles with the height of
the monument and the height of his camera tripod.

𝟐. 𝟕𝟓 𝟑𝟎𝟐. 𝟕𝟓
𝟏𝟓𝟏𝟑. 𝟕𝟓 = 𝟐. 𝟕𝟓𝒉
𝟓𝟓𝟎. 𝟓 ≈ 𝒉
According to Brian’s measurements, the height of the
Washington Monument is approximately 𝟓𝟓𝟎. 𝟓 𝐟𝐭.
Students may want to check the accuracy of this
problem. The actual height of the Washington
Monument is 𝟓𝟓𝟓 𝐟𝐭.

Catarina’s boat has come untied and floated away on the lake. She is standing atop a cliff that is 𝟑𝟓 𝐟𝐭. above the
water in a lake. If she stands 𝟏𝟎 𝐟𝐭. from the edge of the cliff, she can visually align the top of the cliff with the
water at the back of her boat. Her eye level is 𝟓

𝟏
𝐟𝐭. above the ground. Approximately how far out from the cliff is
𝟐

Catarina’s boat?

Catarina’s height and the height of the cliff both are measured perpendicularly to the ground (and water), so both
triangles formed by her visual path are right triangles. Assuming that the ground level on the cliff and the water are
parallel, Catarina’s visual path forms the same angle with the cliff as it does with the surface of the water
(corresponding ∠’s, parallel lines). So, the right triangles are similar triangles by the AA criterion for showing
triangle similarity, which means that the ratios within triangles will be equal. Let 𝒅 represent the distance from the
boat to the cliff:
𝟓. 𝟓 𝟑𝟓
=
𝟏𝟎
𝒅
𝟓. 𝟓𝒅 = 𝟑𝟓𝟎
𝒅 ≈ 𝟔𝟑. 𝟔
Catarina’s boat is approximately 𝟔𝟑. 𝟔 𝐟𝐭. away from the cliff.

6.

Given the diagram below and △ 𝑨𝑩𝑪~ △ 𝑿𝒀𝒁, find the unknown lengths 𝒙, 𝟐𝒙, and 𝟑𝒙.

The triangles are given as similar, so the values of the ratios of the sides within each triangle must be equal.
𝟐
𝒙
=
𝟐𝒙 𝟑𝒙
The sides of the larger triangle are unknown; however, the lengths include the same factor 𝒙, which is clearly
𝟏

nonzero, so the ratio of the sides must then be . Similarly, the sides of the smaller triangle have the same factor 𝟐,
𝟏

𝟑

so the value of the ratio can be rewritten as .
𝒙

𝟏 𝟏
=
𝒙 𝟑
𝒙=𝟑
Since the value of 𝒙 is 𝟑, it follows that 𝒀𝒁 = 𝟑, 𝑨𝑪 = 𝟔, and 𝑿𝒁 = 𝟗.
